            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>firſt part</hi> is inlarged by ſundry circumſtances; as, 1 The time when this combate was, <hi>Then.</hi> 2 The perſon oppoſed, <hi>Jeſus.</hi> 3 His guide, hee <hi>was led by the Spirit.</hi> 4 The place, <hi>into the wilderneſs.</hi> 5 The end why hee came thither, <hi>to be tempted of the Devil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſecond <hi>part,</hi> three points are afforded out of the three Evangeliſts, 1 How hee was furniſhed, <hi>Hee was full of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Luke 4.1. 2 What company hee had, <hi>Hee was with the wilde Beaſts,</hi> Mark. 1.13. 3 What was his imployment. 1 <hi>Hee was tempted,</hi> Luk. 4.2. 2 <hi>Hee faſted forty daies and forty nights, and afterwards was hungry;</hi> which was both the <hi>effect</hi> of his faſt, and the <hi>occaſion</hi> of the firſt temptation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third general part,</hi> namely the entrance of our Saviours adverſary, ſtands in three circumſtances, 1 The time, <hi>then.</hi> 2 The name of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>she Tempter,</hi> before called a <hi>Devil.</hi> 3 The manner of his entrance, <hi>he came.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt circumſtance in the preparation is the circumſtance of time, noted in the word <hi>Then;</hi> which is not a word of ſupplement, but of reference unto the former Hiſtory of Chriſts Baptiſm, which this immediately ſucceedeth: as <hi>Mark</hi> 1.12. <hi>Immediately the Spirit driveth him</hi> (note the preſent tenſe) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wilderneſſe:</hi> ſo as Chriſt went directly from <hi>Jordan</hi> into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then]</hi> 1 When Chriſt undertook his high-office. 2 When hee was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed. 3 When the Spirit had deſcended upon him. 4 When hee had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed teſtimony from Heaven, that hee was the Son of God, and Doctor of his Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Doct.

                     <p>No ſooner is hee <hi>ſet apart</hi> to his office, therein to glorify God, and gratify man, but hee is ſet upon by Satan, a deadly enemy to both. <hi>Moſes</hi> was quiet enough till God ſet him apart to deliver his Brethren, and after that hee was never at quiet. The like may bee ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> an eminent type of Chriſt: while hee kept his fathers ſheep, hee was at reſt; but if hee will ſet upon <hi>Goliah,</hi> and bee annointed King by <hi>Samuel,</hi> let him look to himſelf; <hi>Saul</hi> will hunt him like a Partridge, and ſo narrowly eſpy his haunts, that himſelf will ſay, hee muſt ſurely one day fall by the hand of <hi>Saul.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40284:8"/> right hand to reſiſt him. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo long as hee was of the ſtrict ſect of the Phariſees, hee was highly eſteemed, and lived quiet enough: but when hee became an elect veſſel to carry the Goſpel among the Gentiles, then hee was tryed and buffeted; now hee knows that bonds and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abide him every where, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. &amp; 6.5.</p>

Reach once at Satans head, and hee will ſurely reach as high as hee may at thine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This is not without the good providence of God, who hereby will prove his ſervants, to whom hee will commit ſome ſpecial work, whether they will ſhrink or no: hee will have them alſo to have good proof and trial of his ſtrength and faithfulneſſe in ſupporting them, that they may the better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves unto him in time to come, who hath upheld them formerly, and go on undaunted in conſtant walking with him, through the experience of his goodneſs.</p>

Nay, our Duty is, if wee ſee any buffered by Satan, rather to pray for them, and pitty them, than paſs ſentence (as Judges) upon them, conſidering that our ſelves alſo may bee tempted. And if our ſelves bee not moleſted and troubled, let us take heed wee have not given Satan peaceable poſſeſſion, which makes him now fawn upon us. Many will ſpit at the mention of the Devil, who are linked to him ſure enough, and lulled aſleep with the pleaſures and profits of this world, and are never diſeaſed or diſquieted, becauſe they go on pleaſantly with full ſail and gale to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>

For (ſay they) when it is uttered, the authority of Chriſt is preſent, which they cannot reſiſt. But I anſwer, 1 Never did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles acknowledge any great miracle or work to bee done by the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, Act. 3.6, 13. <hi>By Faith in his name,</hi> which goes beyond the bare repeating of it. 2 Satan delights to ſee ſilly people, being delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to abuſe both this name, and all the names of God to ſorcery; which is the cauſe, that when hee is raiſed by the Sorcerer, bee is content to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by all the holy names of God in the Scripture, as though they bound him: whereas hee deludes them the more, and exerciſeth his malice againſt God in an high meaſure, and his holy titles.
<note place="margin">If Satan fear not the perſon of Jeſus, he leſs fears the name of Jeſus.</note> 3 <hi>If Satan fears not the perſon of Jeſus,</hi> but dares ſet upon him, <hi>certainly hee fears not the name and word.</hi> Chriſt might eaſily (according to Papiſts) have ſhaken off the Devil, and ſaid, What? knoweſt thou not that my name given mee in my circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is <hi>Jeſus?</hi> how dareſt thou bee ſo bold with mee?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If wee conſider as temptation to evil, wee muſt conceive God to bee an actor in that which is evil ſundry waies, though no way the Author of evil: For in the worſt of them all, God doth moſt righteouſly uſe the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40284:12"/> malice of Satan, either in the puniſhing and blinding of the wicked, or in exerciſing and trying his own; both which are juſt and good. As for all the ſin of this action:
<note place="margin">God ſome way an actor in that which is evil, no way an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> 1 It can be no work of God, becauſe it is formally no work at all, but a vice and corruption inherent in it: and 2. It is all left to Satan, who inſtilleth malice, and ſuggeſteth wicked counſels, and that to the deſtruction of men. As for example, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14. an evil ſpirit <hi>of the Lord</hi> vexed <hi>Saul;</hi> that is, ſo farre as it was a juſt puniſhment, it was of God, and Satan was Gods inſtrument in executing his judgements ſo farre as it was a puniſhment: but God left the malice of it to the wicked inſtrument work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after his own manner.</p>
                     <p>But to come to the very point: In the deceiving of <hi>Ahab</hi> and the falſe Prophets, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.22. God not only nakedly and idlely permitted, but expreſly commanded the wicked and lying ſpirit, ſaying, <hi>Goe, and deceive, and prevail:</hi> Where we muſt diſtinguiſh between the righteous action of God as a juſt judgement, and revenge of God, and moſt properly aſcribed unto him; and the malice of it, which was the Devils infuſing corruption inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This ſerves to rectifie our judgements in trials, and clear our eyes to ſee this hand of God in them: commonly wee look too low at men who are but duſt, as though miſery came out of the duſt; and wee look too near us at the ſtaff or ſtone, which with the Dogge we bite, but conſider not the hand that ſmites us, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Abiſhai</hi> looks at <hi>Shemei</hi> that barked at <hi>David,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Why doth this dead Dogge curſe the King?</hi> But <hi>David</hi> could tell him, verſ. 10. <hi>The Lord hath bid him curſe:</hi> that is, he hath ſo decreed and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in his ſecret will bid him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Let us willingly ſubmit our ſelves unto temptations, becauſe God by his Spirit leadeth us to be tempted, as he did his natural Son: ſo Chriſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yeelded himſelf to be tempted, being <hi>led by the Spirit: he was led,</hi> he was not forced and drawn to it, though the trial was as great and fierce, as Satan could make it:

                     <p n="1">1 As we muſt be cheerful in doing the will of God, ſo alſo muſt wee bee cheerful in ſuffering it. True it is, that tryals and perſecutions come often by the Devils means, but never from the Devil. 2 The Lord knoweth beſt in his Divine wiſdome what is beſt for us; and in his fatherly goodneſs diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to us what he knoweth ſo to be. 3 Hee that leadeth us into the liſts, meaſureth our temptations, weigheth our ſtrength, and will not ſuffer us to be tempted above that we are able: he giveth ſhoulders, and fitteth the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. 4 He hath promiſed his preſence with us in ſix dangers, and in ſeven, and goeth out with us into the field, not as a looker on, but to ſupply us with new ſtrength and wiſdome, to help our infirmities, and uphold us unto vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations are forcible to work in us a contentment of minde with Gods fatherly appointment, without which we can never be cheerful in trials: for nature will be working in <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, and when hee is an old Diſciple, he ſhall be led where he would not; and oftentimes the fear of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and trouble,

Now wee pray onely againſt the latter, which is, to bee left, and ſo overcome in temptation; neither doth God ſo lead us into temptation, but to make us in the end more than Conquerors: ſo as ſtill wee may bid Temptations welcome, and with cheerfulneſs ſubmit our ſelves unto them.</p>

Chriſt was not led into temptation by private motion, neither did hee thruſt himſelf unto it: no more muſt wee raſhly run into, or pull dangers upon us, or through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption object ourſelves unto temptations: if wee do,
<note place="margin">Wee muſt not thruſt our ſelves into tryals, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſpirit.</note> wee muſt needs fall, and cannot expect ſafety, becauſe wee tempt the Lord, and provoke him to with-draw his Fatherly protection from us; whereas there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in following the leading and guidance of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Many a man is of ſo ſtrong a faith, that nothing can harm him; hee is for all courſes, and all companies. But how can a man bee ſafe where Satans throne is? <hi>Peter</hi> thought himſelf ſtrong enough to go into the High-Prieſts Hall; but hee found in the end, it was no fit company for him.</p>
                     <p>Others through vain preſidence of Gods protection, run in times of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion into infected houſes, which upon juſt calling a man may: but for one to run out of his calling in the way of an ordinary viſitation, hee ſhall finde that Gods Angels have commiſſion to protect him no longer than hee is in his way, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.11. and that, being out of it, this arrow of the Lord ſhall ſooner hit him than another that is not half ſo confident.</p>
                     <p>Others are bold-hardy to ſet upon the Devil in his own holds, they dare enter into, and lodge in houſes given up by God to the Devils poſſeſſion: which is (if it bee out of ones lawful Calling) to caſt a mans ſelf into moſt probable danger: for whereas wee ought to uſe all good and lawful means for the preventing of imminent danger, this is to ſeek danger and hurt; and commonly they that ſeek it, juſtly find it. The iſſue of ſuch preſumption wee may ſee in the ſons of <hi>Sceva, Act.</hi> 19.16. who took upon them to do as the Apoſtles did, namely to name Chriſt over thoſe that were poſſeſſed; but the Devil ſeeing their want of calling thereunto, ran upon them, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them, ſo as they fled out of the houſe naked and wounded.</p>
                     <p>Others through temerity and raſhneſs, bring on themſelves much woe, who follow the motions of their own ſpirits in their courſes, and never or ſeldome conſider whether they have Gods Spirit before them, or no: they look not for warrant out of Gods Word in the things they do or ſpeak; they begge not Gods direction and aſſiſtance; they ſpy not in what ambuſh Satan lyeth, what advantages hee eaſily taketh, and ſo for want of Chriſtian watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe lay themſelves open to many evils and dangers, wherein they can meet with no great comfort, becauſe they cannot ſay with a good conſcience, Lord, thou haſt led mee into this eſtate; but rather, I have caſt my ſelf into this danger.</p>
                     <p>If therefore thou wouldeſt finde comfort in troubles, keep thee in thy way
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40284:13"/> that thou mayeſt never bee without the leading of the Spirit;
<note place="margin">Three notable effects from aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the ſpirits guidance in trials.</note> and then this will bee the iſſue.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Being led by the Spirit, thou wilt follow willingly, thou wilt lay aſide all reaſonings, excuſes, and delaies, as Chriſt did; hee murmures not, delaies not, doth not firſt return to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> bids not his Parents and friends farewel, conſults not with fleſh and blood, but was driven out with a ſtrong motion ot the Spirit. This is the ſame free Spirit which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the hearts of Chriſtians; hee leads them too, and they obey, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; <hi>Abraham</hi> follows him from his own Countrey, and <hi>Moſes</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 If thou ſee the Spirit leading thee, thou ſhalt not faint under the Croſs, no not when thou lookeſt upon the greateſt danger that can be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe the other eye is upon the Spirit which helpeth thy infirmities, and according to the meaſure of affliction miniſtreth a ſound meaſure of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. therefore the Saints rejoyce in affliction, becauſe the Spirit of glory and of God reſteth upon them. A valiant Captain leading the way, incourageth the moſt timorous ſouldier to follow with courage and reſolution: So this Spirit which leadeth, is a ſpirit of ſtrength, and of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not in himſelf alone, but ſupplying with new ſtrength thoſe that give up themſelves to bee led by him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 If thou ſee the Spirit leading thee into tryal, it will keep thee from ſeeking to winde thy ſelf out by any unlawful or unwarrantable means: thou wilt follow him to bee led out by him, as well as thou waſt led in by him; thou wilt wait his leiſure for the removal of thy Tryal, in whoſe good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it lyeth moſt ſeaſonably to deliver thee. This is often the reaſon why God giveth his children to bee led by the Spirit, to try whether they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with him in temptation, or no. And thoſe who will ſhift themſelves out of trouble, by lying, ſwearing, and the like; or avoid croſſes and loſſes by wicked means, as poverty by breaking the Sabbath, ſickneſs by ſorcery and witchcraft, what ſpirit ſoever led them in, certainly the evil ſpirit hath led them out; the remedy is worſe than their diſeaſe, and their eſcape is made only by breaking the priſon.</p>

Therefore in any ſtrong motion, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy ſelf whether it tend to thy own profit, credit, or luſts: if it do, ſuſpect it, and caſt it off: The Apoſtles in all the motions of the Spirit, reſpected the publike good of the Church, not their own eaſe and reputation. The gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Holy Ghoſt requires denyal of our own wills, ſtrife againſt the ſpirit that beareth rule in the world, and againſt the ſpirit of a man that luſteth after envy. 3 Know it by the excitation of the Spirit, which ſtill ſtirres and moves the will and minde, and raiſeth it from under the oppreſſion of the fleſh, and thus preſerves and maintains the gift of regeneration, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually bends a man to obedience.</p>

                     <p>And this duty is neceſſary, 1 In regard of the unregenerate, who are blind and in darkneſſe, and without a guide know not what way to go: <hi>the natural man perceives not the things of God.</hi> 2 In regard of the regenerate, who are but as little children, weak and feeble, and cannot go without a Leader.

A Coward will bee ready to draw in the ſtreets, that dares not look a man in the face in the field: But Chriſt appoints a field, where Satan may have all his power againſt him, and hee no help at all: and by both theſe hee ſhews himſelf the promiſed ſeed, appointed to bruiſe the Serpents head.</p>

                     <p>Now thus God cannot tempt to evil: he with-draweth his Spirit, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward occaſions he brings to light the ſins of men; and puniſheth one ſin with another, but moveth no man to evil, and much leſs driveth him to it, and leaſt of all infuſeth wickedneſs into any mans heart; which to think were high blaſphemie, So men by tempting may ſtirre up corruption in others, but to infuſe wickedneſs into the heart belongs only to Satan, becauſe of his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual nature, and ready entercourſe with our ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>Now ſeeing theſe temptations of the Devil are ſo wicked, coming from evil, and tending to evil, two points are worthy our conſideration: 1 How Chriſt, being ſo holy and powerful, could be tempted of the Devil. 2 Why he would be ſo tempted.</p>
                     <p>For the former.
<note place="margin">How Chriſt ſo holy and ſo powerful could be tempted of the Devil.</note> 1 It is not againſt the holineſs of Chriſt to be ſubject to temptation without ſin, no more than to hunger, thirſt, weep. 2 Nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of Chriſt to be tempted, no more than it was a ſign of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and weakneſs in <hi>Adam</hi> ſo to be, before infirmity and weakneſs came in. It argued not impotencie in Chriſt, to dye; nay, ſo to dye, argued omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. So it was not weakneſs in Chriſt to be tempted, but willingneſs: and ſo to be tempted argued vertue and ſtrength. But howſoever the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt was tempted, and like us in all things, yet without ſin:</hi> and Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.30. <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nought in me;</hi> that is, no ſin at all: yet it is hard to be conceived, and therefore wee will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it by theſe propoſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That temptation that wholly riſeth from another, and not from a mans ſelf, is not neceſſarily mixed with ſin: But ſuch were the temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to Chriſt, wholly hatched by the Devil: for there was no manner of evil thought, no corruption in the holy perſon of Chriſt for any ſuch to riſe forth of. Wee indeed have many temptations ariſing out of our own corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are ſin in the beginning, though no conſent be given unto them, but are preſently reſiſted: but no ſuch thing could bee in the holy Nature of Chriſt. A fire kindled within the houſe is dangerous; but the lightning coming from without, being but a flaſh, is without danger. <hi>Joſeph</hi> allured by the words of his Miſtris, reſiſted and fled away, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.12. this was not his ſin. And <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> provoked to diſtruſt by <hi>Rabſhakies</hi> rayling letter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, and was confident, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.10. it was not his ſin: the temptation was wholly without.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Thoſe temptations, which are offered by others, either by voyce, geſture, or outward objects; or elſe by inward thoughts, utterly abhorred, without the leaſt liking, are not the ſins of them that are tempted; their exerciſes and trials they be, not their ſins: But ſuch were the temptations of Chriſt; he was troubled and vexed with them, as appears by his <hi>Avoyd Satan;</hi> and the voyces and objects carried to his ear and eye; yea motions to infidelity, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Idolatry, to his mind; but yet by the perfect light of his mind, and the unchangeable holineſs of his will, were inſtantly repelled, and gained not the leaſt affection, and much leſs left the leaſt infection behind them. True it is, that evil thoughts caſt into our mindes, can hardly bee caſt out without ſome taint: for we are ready as tinder to receive ſuch ſparkles; we muſt pauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, till they gain ſome delight, if not content. But it was not ſo with Chriſt, whoſe perfect holineſs was as water to quench all ſuch ſparkles.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Three degrees of temptation.</note> 3 Of temptation there are three degrees: 1 Suggeſtion. 2 Delight. 3 Conſent. Suggeſtion is the meer motion of another, altogether without us, and cannot be our ſin, if neither of the latter come to it; either of which two is a token of infirmity. But Chriſts temptations were all in ſuggeſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſtood laſt without alteration of his minde, without the leaſt delight or conſent to the thing tempted unto. VVhereunto ſerveth that diſtinction of glancing, and permanent motions; the former paſſing through the heart without any footing, againſt no Commandement; the latter either without conſent, againſt the tenth; or with conſent, againſt all the nine.</p>
                     <p>Hence note: 1 <hi>Seeing Chriſt himſelf of ſo holy condition was ſubject to bee tempted, let no man living look to be exempted from temptations.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus that had no inward corruption to ſtirre up any motion in him, cannot avoyd outward objects and perſwaſions to ſin. But our caſe is farre otherwiſe: for ſuppoſe there were no Devil aſſayling us, no outward object that could bee preſented to us, yet we are tempted and led away by our own concupiſcence; we need no moving or ſtirring, but run headlong of our ſelves into ſin. It we had no enemies to batter down our walls and holds without us, wee have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and domeſtical rebells and traytors, which continually betray us. VVhere is the man now that boaſts hee was never tempted, and hee hath ſo ſtrong a faith, and is of ſuch holineſs, as he defieth Satan, and will ſpit in his face, and he never was moleſted by him? But pitiful is this deluſion; Is thy faith ſtronger, thy holineſs greater than Chriſts? No no, Satan is gone away with all, the ſtrong man hath all in peace, elſe thou ſhouldſt hear of him, and tell mean other tale. This example of Chriſt well conſidered, would teach thee another leſſon,
<note place="margin">The greateſt temptation of all is, not to be tempted.</note> namely, like a wiſe man, 1 To expect temptations. 2 Learn to reſiſt them, as Chriſt did. 3 That the greateſt temptation of all, is, not to be tempted: for where Satans malice ſhewes not it ſelf, there is no good thing at all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Note hence, <hi>That all Satans temptations, be they never ſo helliſh and violent, yet cannot hurt us, if we yeeld not to them.</hi> He never more fiercely aſſayled any than Chriſt himſelf, yet Chriſt, giving no way to him, was a little troubled and grieved,
<note place="margin">Satan may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, but hee cannot force us.</note> but not hurt. So all that Satan can doe to us, is but to aſſayl and allure us, but force our wills he cannot; for God hath not put our wills in his power. VVhich ſhould teach us, 1 More carefully to reſiſt the Devil, who never getteth advantage of us, but by our own voluntary yeelding, which rolls us into his ſin and condemnation. 2 Being fallen into ſin, to accuſe our own cowardlineſs and careleſneſs: many being fallen into miſchief, lay load upon the Devil, Oh the Devil ought them a ſpight, and hee hath paid it; and ſo lay all the blame on him, not conſidering their own ſin. True it is, the Devil ſpights every man, and the beſt moſt; but if thou hadſt not more ſpighted thy ſelf, thou hadſt done well enough: the Devil did move, and gave a riſe to a ſin; but who bade thee perfect and finiſh it? Can the Devil make thee ſin without thy ſelf? I deny not but that thou canſt not lay too much blame upon the Devil, but ſee thou layeſt not too little upon thy ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Note: in that therefore Chriſt fully overcame, and was not touched with temptation, becauſe by the perfection of his holineſs hee reſiſted at the firſt we muſt learn this wiſdome; <hi>if we would not fall by temptation, to reſiſt the firſt motions, and beat back the firſt aſſault, which is a great advantage.</hi> For, if Satan can get us to reſt upon his ſuggeſtion, hee preſently hopes for conſent, and then haſteneth the execution forward: for the party is wonn, and the means of executing ſhall not be farre to ſeek. Hence are we commanded, <hi>to give no place to the Devil,</hi> but to break the head of the Serpent, hit <hi>Goliah in the fore-head,</hi> tread on ſin in the ſhell, and daſh Satans brood againſt the ſtones while they are infants.

                     <p>Wee may well aſſure our ſelves, that it being in his power, hee would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo voluntarily have yielded himſelf to ſuch an unpleaſant combat with ſo ſoul an enemy, had there not been very weighty and urgent cauſes. And theſe we ſhall ſee moſt ſpecially reſpecting us rather than himſelf: hee was incarnate, not for himſelf, but for us: hee ſuffered in our nature, not for himſelf, but for us, <hi>that by his ſtripes wee might bee healed:</hi> hee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and vanquiſhed the Devil, not for himſelf, who was never under his power, but for us; and ſo was tempted, not for himſelf, but for us; and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That hee might through temptation win that, which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> through temptation loſt, and that as our fall was begun by temptation, ſo alſo might our deliverance; that as the Serpent by tempting the woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved us of our happineſſe; ſo the ſame Serpent, by tempting this ſeed of the woman, might againſt his will help us to our happineſs again.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That by his temptation he ſhould not onely overcome ours, as by his death hee deſtroyed ours; but by his reſiſtance to leave us a pattern how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Devil. Hee is the chief Doctor, who not onely teacheth by Precept, but by unfailing example, how wee may riſe from under temptation. Hee might have driven back the Devil with a word, but then had wee want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the benefit of his example, which hath both ſhewed us our coat-armour, and the right manner of uſing it as hee did. As a faithful Captain, hee trains his Souldiers, and as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid to his Souldiers, <hi>What yea ſee mee do, that do you.</hi>
                     </p>

He is able ſufficiently to have compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that are ignorant and out of the way, becauſe hee was compaſſed with infirmity. So as if Chriſt had not had experience of the force, craft, inſtance
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40284:19"/> of the <hi>Tempter,</hi> and of the miſery, danger, weakneſs of the tempted, ſo far as without ſin hee could, hee had not been ſo able to ſuccour them that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as now hee is.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 That by his temptation hee might miniſter ſundry grounds of comfort unto us:
<note place="margin">A ground of comfort out of Chriſts temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> as 1 That our temptations and tryals are not ſignes of Gods wrath, no more than they were to Chriſt, of whom hee had immediately before witneſſed that hee was the Son of his love: but exerciſes, which the Lord in wiſdome uſeth for the good of his Children. If it had been evil to bee tempted, certainly Chriſt had not been tempted.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That wee ſhould not quail at the ſight of our enemy, as all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at the ſight of <hi>Goliah,</hi> but, although hee bee never ſo huge and ſtrong a Gyant, yet hee may bee, and is overcome, and that by Chriſt, true man, in the fleſh: Yea, this victory over Satan, in our nature, and by our head, is the ground of ours, to whom hee will alſo give power to do the ſame. 3 That wee have him a Companion, yea, an invincible captain in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, who can never bee overcome; but at the weakeſt, and alone, like a mighty <hi>Sampſon,</hi> ſlew down heaps upon heaps, and bore away his enemies gates; and his preſence ſhall make us invincible, that look as <hi>Daniels</hi> fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, could not bee touched with the fire, becauſe there was a fourth like the Son of God with them; ſo much leſs ſhall Gods children by Satans moſt fiery temptations, ſo long as the Son of God is with them. 4 That wee might ſee in him, what glory follows victory, and what crowns are prepared for the Conquerours, and ſo comfort our ſelves in all difficulties, to hold out unto victory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Seeing Chriſt was tempted, let not us bee diſmayed at temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<note place="margin">Motives to manful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of temptation.</note> but rather encouraged manfully to reſiſt them: For 1 <hi>By vertue of Chriſts temptations, ours are ſanctified unto us.</hi> There was nothing which Chriſt did, but hee ſanctified the ſame to us, publike inſtitutions of Gods worſhip ſpeaking and hearing the word, prayer, the Sacraments; and all other private Ordinances, meat, drink, ſleep, yea, even infirmities that are without ſin, pain, ſorrow, temptations, nay death, and the grave: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of a gate to Hell, being ſanctified for a wicket to heaven; the latter of a ſtinking Cave to reſerve the body for torment, altered into a ſweet bed to preſerve it to eternal joy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 By Chriſts temptation, being our head, the force, and ſtrength, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of our temptations is abated, ſo as Satan cannot now ſo fiercely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault his members. Temptation may fitly bee compared to a ſword, which, beaten upon a rock or ſtone, is ſo far from peircing the ſtone, as it turneth the edge, and makes it more unable afterward to hurt. The Devil took this ſword, and laid on with both hands upon Chriſt; but he, as the ſtone hewen out of the mountain, bears the blows, turnes the edge, and blunted his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, that they can never ſo ſharply peirce the Members. The proud and furious waves of the Sea, beating themſelves againſt a hard rock, break them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and loſe all their ſtrength: So is it here with the billows of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, beating themſelves againſt the rock on which the Church is built.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 For our further encouragement, in that Chriſt was tempted, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in temptation, wee have aſſured hope of victory againſt Satan, as Chriſt our Head had: for hee hath trode Satan under his feet for us, nay, <hi>under our feet too, Rom.</hi> 16.20.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Oh but wee are yet mightily aſſailed, and in great perplexity.</hi>
                     </p>

In that Chriſt was pleaſed to bee aſſailed with ſundry temptations, let us look up unto this Author and finiſher of our faith, and ſet before us our pattern of imitation, who overcame not Satan for himſelf, as the Saints have done, but for our ſalvation, and for our imitation. <hi>The former,</hi>

Thus Chriſt was typified by the High Prieſts in the Law, who were ſubject to like infirmities with others, that they might bee ready to comfort, and pray, and offer for them.

                     <p>Firſt, Chriſt went armed to the combate with Satan, <hi>Hee was full of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which had formerly lighted upon him in the ſhape of a Dove, and had ſo extraordinarily fenced him with graces of ſanctification above meaſure, that there was no room to faſten any temptation upon him.

                     <p>Object. <hi>But ſome of the Saints, as</hi> John Baptiſt, <hi>and</hi> Stephen, <hi>have been full of the Holy Ghoſt, and yet have been foyled by temptation.</hi>

And this is that which Gods children may expect; not to bee exempted from temptation, nor from much moleſtation, nor from many knocks and foiles, which bring them much ſorrow: but yet at length God, whoſe hand is under them, brings them through all. For ſo it is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. God is faithful, and will nor ſuffer you to bee tempted above that yee are able, but with every temptation will give an iſſue.

                        <note place="margin">Why Chriſt was with wilde beaſts: Four Reaſons.</note> But the true and proper cauſes were theſe: 1 To ſhew what kind of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs this was, namely not ſuch as that in which <hi>John</hi> preached; of which there were many in <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> which were diſtinguiſhed by their ſpecial names, as the Deſert of <hi>Judea,</hi> of <hi>Ziph,</hi> of <hi>Maon,</hi> &amp;c. and ſuch as were not altogether deſert, and without people, or incommodious for men to dwell in, but were here and there inhabited: But this Deſert, wherein Chriſt was tempted, not noted by any addition, but the Deſert, was remote from all company of men, and full of wilde beaſts; by which it is plain it was unpeopled, and had no inhabitants but the wilde beaſts.</p>
                     <p>If any ask, <hi>which Wilderneſs it was;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, it is not determined in the Scripture; but it is not unlikely but it was that great VVilderneſs, in which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wandred fourty years, called by eminence, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>the Wilderneſs.</hi> And we know, that there were ſome figures, which might ſhadow the temptation in this place; as <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.7. it is called <hi>the place of temptation, Maſſah</hi> and <hi>Meribah,</hi> becauſe of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and tempting the Lord; here the Lord was contended with and tempted. Again, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.4. this was the place wherein the Lord ſhewed them, that <hi>man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God:</hi> compare it with <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. This alſo was the VVilderneſs, in which <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> faſted forty days; and if it were not the ſame, it muſt needs bee figured by it. But it is no Article of Faith, to be ſtood upon, or contended about.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This circumſtance of Hiſtory is added, to ſhew how helpleſs Chriſt was, without all help and comfort of man, where hee could look for no ſuccour from any earthly creature, or worldly means, nay all the means againſt him: 3. To ſhew that his power was ſo much the more manifeſt, in that when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had him at the greateſt advantage, and all the means ſet againſt him, yet he goes away victor; and that none could ſhare with him in the praiſe of the victory, but it belonged to him of all the ſeed of women. 4 To ſhew the power of the Son of God, who could live peaceably among the wilde beaſts, who, if he had been a common and weak man, had been certainly eaten up of them.</p>

But I take it, another reaſon may bee given of Chriſts peaceable converſe among the ſavage creatures, namely, becauſe hee was endued with the perfect Image of God, and they did acknowledge him as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40284:21"/> their Lord, even as they did <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall; which is a ſpecial privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſtate of innocency.</p>

A great deal more ſecurity ſhall he find in the VVilderneſs among wilde beaſts, than in places inhabited by wicked men. And the reaſon ſeems to bee, that the higher the fall, the greater the wound; the Devil falling from ſuch a height of glory, is moſt deſperately wicked againſt Gods Image, eſpecially in his Son: wicked men falling from a bleſſed eſtate of holineſs and renewed reaſon, are deſperately malicious too, ſo as the poor creatures in their proportion retain more goodneſs in their nature than man doth in his; they ſtill ſerve God in their kinds, man ſtill rebelleth; they fell from ſubjection to man, but man from ſubjection to God.</p>

                        <hi>Note</hi> 2.

                        <hi>Note</hi> 3. In that our Saviour now is ſafe enough, when all the means of ſafety and comfort are ſet againſt him, we muſt learn to depend upon him, if we ſhall come into the like caſe: when we have no way to help our ſelves, all means fail, nay all means are againſt us,
<note place="margin">Chriſt as able to defend us as himſelf, both from wilde beaſts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</note> like ſo many wilde beaſts about us, then he is able to ſuccour us, as he was to defend himſelf alone, not only from the rage of wilde beaſts, but furious Devils. And this is the true trial of faith, when we have no means, yea when means are againſt us. It is an eaſie thing to truſt God upon a pawn, but we muſt truſt in his word, that is indeed to truſt in God. When the caſe is with us as it was with <hi>Moſes</hi> at the red Sea, the Sea afore him, the Mountains on both ſides, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt behind, then to ſay, Stand ſtill, fear not, and behold the ſalvation of the Lord, here is ſound faith.

                     <p>Now wee come to the third point in Chriſts expectation of his enemy, namely, <hi>His imployment;</hi> and that out of the Evangeliſts is gathered to bee twofold: 1 <hi>Faſting,</hi> to which hee joyned prayer without all doubt: this S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath, that <hi>hee faſted forty daies and forty nights.</hi> 2 <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> by lighter onſets, as <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith plainly, <hi>hee was forty daies there tempted of the Devil,</hi> and after that hee was hungry; and then began theſe three temptations.</p>
                     <p>In his faſt, conſider three things: 1 What kind of faſt it was. 2 The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it. 3 The continuance, forty daies and forty nights.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt. Of faſts there are three kinds.
<note place="margin">Kinds of faſts, three.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 Civil, as when men faſt for the health of their body; or when men are ſo intent upon their affairs, as they take no time to eat and drink: Thus <hi>Saul</hi> faſted purſuing the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.24. and thoſe forty, that vowed not to eat till they had ſlain <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo intent they were upon their wickedneſs, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.14. This is voluntary; there is alſo one involuntary faſt, when men want what to eat and drink, as <hi>Elias</hi> faſted, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.5. This is not here meant.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Religious, which is an abſtinence from meats, drinks, and all delights, to teſtify our true humiliation before God, to fit us unto prayer, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and witneſs the truth of our Repentance. And this is either publike or private, of one or of more, for one day or longer time. But neither is this meant here: For, 1 Chriſt had no corrupt, wanton, or rebellious fleſh to mortify, or chaſtiſe. 2 Chriſt had nothing to repent of, no amendment of life, no hardneſſe of heart, no want of faith to bewail, no guiltineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs by it. 3 Hee had no need of faſting to help him in prayer: for neither needed hee any grace, which he had not by the lighting of the Spirit upon him, neither had hee any ſluggiſhneſs or dulneſs in his nature to hinder his prayer, neither did hee ever make a prayer, which did not merit of it ſelf to bee heard, or wherein hee was not heard.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Miraculous, which is above the ſtrength of man, and is ſometime gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Saints, to commend their doctrin, as unto <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 24.18. and to <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. And of this kind was our Saviours faſt; becauſe no man can faſt ſo long, or half ſo long, and remain alive; and much leſs can a man faſt ſo long, and not bee hungry all the while, as it is ſaid of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The reaſons of this faſt are, 1 Negative: 2 Affirmative. I Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. 1 It was not to commend faſting, as the Papiſts teach: for it is no commendation to faſt when one hath no ſtomack, or is not hungry, as Chriſt was not. Beſides, it is in it ſelf no worſhip of God, but a thing indifferent, and onely commanded, and commendable, ſo far as it is an help to religious exerciſes. 2 Much leſs that wee ſhould imitate him, as the Papiſts do in their Lent-fall: For 1 it is none of the moral imitable actions of Chriſt, but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected as other miracles by a power tranſcending the ſtrength of men and Angels, yea, by the ſame power whereby hee gave ſight to the blinde, and leggs to the lame; hee is as imitable in one as in the other. 2 If they will imitate Chriſt they muſt abſtain from all food, not onely from fleſh, and that for forty daies and forty nights: for Chriſt all this while are nothing: yea, and they muſt not bee hungry all the while, as hee was not, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.2. 3 Chriſt did not faſt once a year as they do, but once in all his life. 4 There is no proportion, no agreement between Chriſts faſt, and their Lenten faſt: for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Chriſts was a total faſt an utter abſtinence; theirs is a mock-faſt: They
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40284:23"/> glut themſelves in the time of their faſt with moſt dainty meats and drinks, in fulneſs and delicacy.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <note place="margin">Chriſts faſt diſagreeth from Popiſh faſts in ſeven things, or eight.</note> 2 Chriſts was voluntary, theirs is forced, againſt the uſe of the Primitive Church, among whom it was left free to every mans Conſcience, when and how long it pleaſed him to uſe it: neither were any Laws ſet down for the Lent-faſt yearly to be kept in imitation of Chriſt, till <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, or (as other write) <hi>Teleſphorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> about four hundred years after Chriſt; but it was free for the time, and kinds of meats.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Chriſts faſt was for a neceſſary cauſe; theirs in times of joy, when no juſt cauſe urgeth, for the times ſake, for cuſtom, and ſuperſtitious imitation, when no publike danger is to be prevented, nor any ſpecial grace to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; whereas by Chriſts faſt the greateſt evil in the world was diverted, and the greateſt good procured.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Chriſts was without oſtentation, in ſecret in the Wilderneſs, when none ſaw him; whereas in Cities and ſocieties of men, hee ate and drank: but theſe will bee known to faſt, and with the <hi>Phariſee</hi> profeſs, <hi>I faſt twice a week,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Chriſt faſted not as counting ſome meats unclean, which are all good, and ought not to be refuſed, as unclean; but received with thankſgiving, as ſanctified by the Word and Prayer, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. They faſt with condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of fleſh, and whatſoever cometh of it, as unclean for that time: which is more Jewiſh than Judaiſm it ſelf: for even in the Ceremonial Law, thoſe things that were pronounced unclean, were never to bee refuſed as unclean in themſelves, but only in regard of the Commandement: But much more now, all difference of meats being taken away; according to <hi>Peters</hi> viſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.11. may all be lawfully uſed at all times for the nouriſhment of man: and the contrary is <hi>a doctrin of Devils.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 Chriſt faſted not without inſtant prayer: for even the Saints of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies when they did faſt, joyned prayer, which otherwiſe were but a bodily exerciſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And hence faſting is often put for faſting and prayer, <hi>Heſter</hi> 4.3, 16. But they faſt in want of extraordinary prayer, and when no need or occaſion is above ordinary.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Chriſt did not faſt as placing the Kingdom of God in meats and drinks; whereas they account the obſervation of their faſts a thing meritorious, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for ſin, and purchaſe the Kingdom of Heaven; which is their common doctrin: wherein what elſe doe they, than attribute the Kingdom of God to meat and drink?</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Let them ſhew where the people of God ever preſumed to imitate the faſts of <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Elias:</hi> if they cannot, how dare they embolden themſelves to imitate Chriſt, and injoyn the meaneſt of their Diſciples ſo to doe under pain of Damnation? for this is the boldneſs of <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſaying, As Chriſt forty days after his Reſurrection aſcended to Heaven, ſo none can aſcend thither that faſteth not theſe forty days.</p>
                     <p>And yet here I condemn not the Lent-faſt among us, ſo it be obſerved only as a civil and politick Ordinance, and not as any religious faſt or obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for I eſteem it as lawful for a King for a time to forbid his ſubjects ſome ſorts of meat, and injoyn others as he ſeeth moſt fit for his Common-wealth, as for a Phyſician to preſcribe a diet to his Patient, forbidding ſome meats, and appointing others for the health of his body. Much leſs doe I condemn all faſting in general, but wiſh it were more obſerved than it is, ſo it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But this faſt of the Papiſts, in the inſtitution, obſervation, cauſes, manner, and end of it, is wicked and ſacrilegious.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 To prepare himſelf by faſting and prayer to his moſt weighty calling: for although Chriſt was <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſeemed not to need the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40284:23"/> of faſting and prayer to fit him, yet he took on him our infirmities with our nature, and as man needed ſuch help as our ſelves doe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To teach us, not raſhly and headily to enter upon or undertake any cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but by faſting and prayer to prepare our ſelves, who have more need of preparation than Chriſt had, and to get Gods bleſſing on the ſame: but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally this concerns the Magiſtrate and Miniſter.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>You ſaid this fast was not for our imitation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, it was not in the extent, but in the end it was: in the former Chriſt is to be admired, in the latter to be imitated.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 To ſet out his Miracles and Divine power, for the honour and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Perſon and Doctrin, to ſhew himſelf the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>Obj. Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>faſted this faſt, and yet were meer men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> They did it by his power, he by his own: they were upheld by the power of God, but he by his Divine power: their faſting was but a type and ſhadow of this. But to make every man able to imitate this faſt, obſcures Chriſts glory, and this Miracle, and the Goſpel it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 That hereby he might bid battel, offer opportunity, and provoke his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to the combate: for this was the end both of his faſting, and going <hi>into the Wilderneſs,</hi> and of his hunger. Wherein alſo this faſt of Chriſt may not be imitated: for we are not to offer any opportunities or advantages to Satan, who is ready enough to ſeek and take enough: as we may <hi>not tempt God,</hi> ſo we may not tempt the tempter, but pray that we may <hi>not be lead into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> by him, and watch leſt we fall into temptation, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.38. yea we muſt cut off and prevent his advantages, and ſhun all occaſions wherein hee might aſſault us, as knowing our own weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>The third thing in Chriſts faſt is the continuance of time,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> For theſe reaſons: 1 To bee anſwerable to the types. As <hi>Moſes</hi> faſted forty days at the inſtitution of the Law, and <hi>Elias</hi> at the reſtitution of it, ſo would Chriſt here at the manifeſtation of the Goſpel. 2 He exceeded not his number, leſt he ſhould ſeem too inhuman and cruel againſt himſelf: for he did no more than <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had done, men ſubject to infirmity. In our time he is no man that cannot ſtrain one trick above others: but Chriſt being in the ſhape of a Servant, takes not upon him above his fellow-ſervants. 3 He would not faſt leſs, becauſe he would not ſeem leſs than the Prophets, nor unlike them. 4 He would not faſt more, becauſe he would not have his Deity now acknowledged by the Devil. 5 He would not give occaſion to Hereticks to doubt of the truth of his body and human nature: If he had faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed longer than <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> he might have been thought no true man, but only in ſhew incarnate.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it added, that he faſted forty nights?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> For theſe reaſons:
<note place="margin">Forty nights added for two reaſons.</note> 1 To ſhew that it was not ſuch a faſt as the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to keep, who faſted many days together, but ate at nights; as <hi>Daniel</hi> faſted for three weeks of days, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. Nor like the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> faſts, who ſo ſoon as they ſee a ſtarre, eat any thing on their faſting days, but that which is ſtrangled, or Hogges fleſh. Nor yet like the Papiſts faſt, who, though they ſay they faſt forty days, both to imitate Chriſt, and to give God the tithe of the year, yet can feed well and fare deliciouſly every night.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To ſhew, that Chriſt had a care to ſpend his nights well, as well as his days, not ſpending them out in ſleep, but in watching and prayer as well as in faſting: for by the ſame power his body was preſerved without ſleep, as it was without meat. Farre unlike the Papiſts, who in their faſting-days ſpend the night in gluttony, luxury, and all uncleaneneſs.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Doct. Faſting a moſt neceſſary duty.</note> This example of Chriſt teacheth us of what great neceſſity this exerciſe of faſting is, both for the entrance, and comfortable continuance of the duties of our calling, both general and ſpecial. This <hi>Nehemiah</hi> knew well, when hearing of the calamity of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and his brethren the Jews, hee faſted certain daies, and prayed before the God of heaven, chap. 1. v. 4. And <hi>Ezra</hi> proclaimed a faſt, to ſeek the right way homeward, and ſafe from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, chap. 8. v. 21. ſee alſo <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3.</p>

                        </label> 1 Faſting in an holy and religious manner, helpeth forward graces that are neceſſary for our calling; as, 1 the grace of converſion, and therefore is made an adjunct of it: <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Turn you with all your heart, with faſting and weeping.</hi> 2 The grace of prayer; for as Prayer ſanctifieth faſting, ſo faſting ſtrengtheneth prayer. Otherwiſe, to place Gods worſhip in faſting is to make the belly the God. 3 It helps forward the knowledge of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God and godlineſſe: <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3. conferred with 20.21. as <hi>Daniel</hi> was praying and faſting, <hi>Gabriel</hi> was ſent to inſtruct him, and revealed to him the myſtery of the ſeventy weeks. 4 It addes ſtrength and courage in the Chriſtian combate between the fleſh and the ſpirit; it is as a third, that comes in to take the ſpirits part, and ſo helpeth to the victory by ſubduing the fleſh.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The neceſſity and profit of this exerciſe appeareth in reſpect of our ſelves: for, 1 If wee want publike or private benefits, faſting joyned with prayer is the means wherein God will have them ſought and obtained. The <hi>Benjamites</hi> after two ſore overthrows, by this means got the victory, <hi>Jud.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Annah</hi> by the ſame obtained her <hi>Samuel:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> faſted for his childes life. 2 If wee bee in danger of publike or perſonal judgements, by the ſame means they are to bee diverted: religious faſting is a chief part of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive armour of the Church, as wee may ſee in the examples of <hi>Heſter,</hi> ſaving her people from <hi>Hamans</hi> deviſe: and of the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> turning away the deſtruction threatned by <hi>Jonah,</hi> by faſting and humbling themſelves. 3 If wee bee to attempt publike or private duties, hereby wee muſt fit our ſelves, and obtain ſucceſs and bleſſing. So did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Ezra;</hi> as wee ſaw before: and when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſeparated to the work of the miniſtery, they faſted and prayed, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3. Yea, Chriſt himſelf ſpent a whole night in faſting and prayer, before he choſe his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.12, 13.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Daily experience ſhews the neceſſity of religious faſting: for, 1 How many men obſerve in themſelves, that for want of this duty they grow dull in their profeſſion, and heavy in holy practices, yea, empty of grace, ſo as they may think the Spirit is departed from them? yet when they have renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this exerciſe, they finde themſelves more ripe and ready, more quick and able to good duties, as if they had new ſoules given them. 2 Do wee not ſee, that the more conſcionably a man carrieth himſelf, the more buſily Satan doth beſtir himſelf againſt him? and had hee not need ſo much the more fence himſelf with coat-armour, and flye to God for ſtrength and protection? If a good Magiſtrate or Miniſter bee to bee brought into any place, how doth Satan ſtorm and bend his forces againſt him, becauſe hee thinks that then his Kingdome muſt down? Therefore if a man mean to be ſerviceable to God in any place, it is meet hee ſhould firſt ſanctify it by faſting and prayer, as Chriſt did.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This ſerves to rebuke the great want of this ſo needful a duty. What Magiſtrate or Miniſter, againſt whom Satan moſt ſhooteth, entreth thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his calling, as Chriſt by faſting and prayer; but by gifts, favour, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe get livings and offices? but to God they go not; and this is the cauſe that ſo little good is done, either in one calling or the other: as much bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as they ſeek, they have. So, what other reaſon can bee given, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40284:24"/> many lingring evils, and want of Gods bleſſing is in ſo many families; but becauſe men omit the chief means of procuring the one, and repelling the other? Men think they have nothing to do with this duty, but when publike authority enjoyns it, and that it is onely the fault of Magiſtracy it is ſo out of uſe; as though every Maſter of a family were not a Magiſtrate and Biſhop in his own houſe; or as if that were not a means for private bleſſings, which is ſo mighty for publike. Oh deceive not thy ſelf: that which thou canſt not do publikely, thou maieſt do in thine own houſe; and therefore, if thou wanteſt any grace or bleſſing, blame thine own idleneſs that ſeekeſt it not in Gods means.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This ſhould move us to perform ſo needful a duty as this is,
<note place="margin">Motives to faſting 6.</note> and thereunto to conſider of theſe reaſons. 1 Conſider the Promiſes that are made, and have been made good to faſting and fervent prayer. Remember that one example of good King <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> againſt whom came the <hi>Moabites, Ammonites,</hi> and they of Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> whereupon hee proclaimed a faſt throughout all <hi>Judah,</hi> and prayed earneſtly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.2, 17. and before they had ended their Prayer, the Spirit of the Lord came upon <hi>Jahaziel</hi> a Levite, who by the Spirit of Prophecy foretold the victory, ſaying, <hi>Yee ſhall not need to fight in this battel, O</hi> Judah, <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>Fear yee not, but to morrow go out againſt them, and the Lord will bee with you:</hi> and ſo it came to paſs: for the enemies ſlew one another, and the <hi>Jews</hi> gathered the ſpoil, and returned and praiſed God in the valley of <hi>Beracha,</hi> that is, of bleſſing; ſo called ever after.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The ordinary prayers of Gods children have prevailed much, and much more can their faſting and prayer bring greater bleſſings. When <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was in priſon, ſleeping between two ſouldiers, the night before he ſhould bee brought out to death, being bound with two chaines, and the Keeper before the door watching the Priſon, at the <hi>ordinary Prayer</hi> of the Church, an Angel ſmote <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Ariſe quickly,</hi> and his chains fell off, and hee was delivered, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.5. much more can <hi>Extraordinary Prayer,</hi> joyned with faſting, prevail.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Many things are not obtained, but by that prayer which is joyned to faſting, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.14. this kind (of Devils) is not caſt out but by prayer and faſting, that is, by a moſt fervent kind of Prayer, to which faſting is joyned as a whetſtone to ſharpen it, and ſet an edge on it. Some things, as thoſe that are pretious, coſt a greater price; and ſome ſutes muſt bee obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of men, not without long and inſtant ſupplication: ſo here, many things are long ſought by ordinary prayer, which being extraordinary favours, might by extraordinary prayer have been ſooner had.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 God hath rewarded the wicked, who have uſed this Ordinance in Hypocriſy; and much more will hee thoſe his ſervants that uſe it in truth, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.21. <hi>Ahab</hi> faſting for the deſtruction threatned by <hi>Elijah,</hi> humbled himſelf; and this faſt of his, not joyned with true repentance, but onely kept in the outward ceremony, in abſtaining from meat, in ſackcloth, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome teſtimony of outward ſorrow, was not unrewarded, but obtained a reprieve of the execution of the ſentence, till his Sons dayes. How much more reſpect ſhall wee obtain of God, if wee joyn to the outward faſt the inward graces of humility, repentance, faith, and fervency?</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Were this exerciſe in requeſt ſometimes in families, it would prevent many judgements, and many ſins the procurers thereof, in governours, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſervants; as adultery, fornication, drunkenneſs, ſwearing, riot, and prophaneneſs; theſe might bee kept out as well as caſt out by this means: and unſpeakable were the good that might hereby be procured, as releaſe from many evils, life, health, &amp;c.</p>

                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40284:25"/>6 We have the example of the Jews, who beſides all other moveable faſts upon ſpecial occaſion, muſt have one ſet faſt in a year, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.29. 1 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many great ſins of all ſorts might be committed in a year, for which they needed to be humbled. 2 Once a year God might ſhew ſome tokens of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, publick or private, that they might know that once a year they had cauſe to be humbled.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>That was a Ceremony?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> The day was, not the thing, the equity of which binds us as well as them, becauſe the ends and cauſes bind us. And in the Goſpel wee have the example of <hi>John</hi> and his Diſciples, who faſted often: and Chriſts Diſciples muſt faſt, when the Bridegroom is gone, and cauſes of mourning come.</p>
                     <p>Beſide theſe, we have ſundry other motives to religious faſting: as,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Shall Chriſt faſt for us, and not we for our ſelves?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Shall the Phariſees faſt twice a week in hypocriſie, and wee not once in our lives in ſincerity?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Can we cheerfully betake us for our bodily health to faſting, diet, or abſtinence ſo long as the Phyſician will preſcribe, and will we doe nothing for our ſouls health?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Can worldly men for a good market faſt from morning to evening, and can Chriſtians be ſo careleſs as to dedicate no time to the exerciſe of faſting and prayer, to increaſe their <hi>gain of godlineſs?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5 Is not this a ſeaſonable exhortation? hath not God ſounded the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to faſting? <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.16. when the Bridegroom is taken away, it is time to faſt. But now,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Sins abound, as Drunkenneſs, Pride, and high wickedneſs, and there is no more fear of Gods wrath in the Church and Land. 2 The Word and Miniſtery is more deſpiſed than ever, and leſs loved; Preachers and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Goſpel are ſcorned, as in the days of <hi>Noah;</hi> the heavenly <hi>Mannah</hi> is contemned, and the contempt of it threatneth a final departure ot the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. 3 Papiſts increaſe in numbers, in boldneſs, in pride, in power, and are ſo farre from being converted by the light, as they are daily more perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and perverſe, notwithſtanding the glorious Goſpel of God, and the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws of the Land. Adde unto theſe the ſwarms of Atheiſts, <hi>Machevili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> carnal and cold Proteſtants among us. 4 Who hath not ſmarted in the common judgements of the Land, lingring by many years in plagues, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable weather, fires, waters, and the like, all of them fore-runners of greater miſery? Who can forget the warning of Gun-powder, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unfeelingneſs of it?</p>
                     <p>And were not theſe publike evils, how may every one of us bewail Chriſts hiding of himſelf from our ſouls? His gracious beams ſhine not on us with ſuch comfort as they might, his Word is not ſo fruitful in the beſt as it ſhould, dulneſs and conformity with the times creep in upon the beſt; the Sun and Moon, great Lights in the Miniſtry, are darkned, and the Starres loſe their light among profeſſors. Is it not time to awake our ſelves, if ever, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our ſelves to ſack-cloth and aſhes, to faſting and prayer, if the Lord may be intreated to draw neerer us, and our ſouls nearer him?</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of Chriſts employment, while he expected his enemy, was temptation by lighter onſets, which is plain, in that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>he was forty days tempted of the Devil;</hi> and then recordeth Satans ſolemn onſets upon him in theſe three moſt fierce temptations.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40284:25"/> out a wing to make a skirmiſh only, to try their purpoſe and ſtrength; ſo doth Satan here: he would by leſſer temptations try the ſtrength or weakneſs of Chriſt, that ſo he might plant his main forces againſt him accordingly. 2 He begins with ſmaller things before he come with his main forces and ſhew his blackneſs, becauſe ſmaller things are eaſily contemned, or more eaſily yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto: <hi>Is it not a little out? and is there any great hurt in it?</hi> 3 He knows by little things how to obtain great, eaſily winding himſelf by little and little into the heart, as a cunning Thief, if he can find room but for the point of a wrinch, will quickly make ſtrong doors to fly open. 4 Hee will try if by ſmall things he can make us ſecure, and negligent to put on all Gods Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to fence us, becauſe wee eaſily think that ſmaller things need no great reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. As he dealt with Chriſt our head, ſo doth hee with his members:
<note place="margin">Where Satan beginneth his temptation, we muſt begin out reſiſtance.</note> therefore as Chriſt was able enough to eſpy his fleight, ſo muſt wee learn to doe; <hi>even where Satan begins his temptation, there to begin our reſiſtance, and give him the repulſe at his first motion:</hi> we muſt reſiſt ſmaller temptations, and keep off of the firſt ſtaff of the Devils ladder, and kill every helliſh Serpent in the ſhell. 1 We muſt doe as wiſe Citizens that are beſieged, and will not let the enemy come to ſcale the wall, or into the Market-place with purpoſe to drive him out again, but keep them out without bullets reach. 2 We are wiſe to prevent bodily diſeaſes at the firſt grudgings, becauſe wee know that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſeaſes get ſtrength by delay, and are hardly removed if they be ſuffered to ſettle. 3 Satan firſt lays objects and occaſions, and then tempts or works upon them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> was firſt moved to look upon <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> which ſeemed a ſmall thing: but had he had his armour on his eye, his heart had been fenced from the deſire, and himſelf from the act. <hi>Peter</hi> was not firſt moved to forſwear his Maſter, but firſt to goe into the High Prieſts Hall, or to follow aloof off and then to ſit among <hi>Chriſts</hi> enemies, and then to doe as they did. The Devil comes firſt aloof, and ſeems to require but ſome reaſonable thing at firſt, but at laſt is impudent and importunate for greater. Doe we think that <hi>Judas</hi> was at firſt moved to betray his innocent Lord? No, but firſt Satan wrought him to covetouſneſs, and then offered the occaſion, thirty pieces of ſilver, and ſo ſtruck up the matter by degrees, and in the end oppreſſed him with his whole power.</p>
                     <p>Even ſo to draw a man from God and religion, hee will begin with leſſer things; he will not bid a man hate religion at firſt, but firſt to doubt of this point or that, or hate, not all at firſt, but this Miniſter or that; he ſets before his eyes ſome infirmities, which breed diſlike, then hee moves him to take counſel againſt him, then to ſcorn, rail, perſecute him. When <hi>Saul</hi> was commanded utterly to deſtroy the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> men and cattel, and ſpare none, the Devil thought it bootleſs to goe againſt the whole Commandement of God, by moving him to ſpare all; but he might think it reaſonable to ſpare ſome, the King, and the fat beaſts, eſpecially upon ſo good an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to ſacrifice: but this was enough to depoſe him from his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore remember theſe rules: 1 <hi>To give no place to the Devil,</hi>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40284:26"/> indeed?</hi> not that he did not know it, but his further drift was to make her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake that word, as indeed ſhe did. So he comes to many a man, as to <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſaith, Goe into ſuch and ſuch company among thy neighbours, to ſuch or ſuch an exerciſe; which is a ſmall thing: but hee hath a further drift; there thou ſhalt loſe thy time, and thruſt thy ſelf out of thy calling, there thou ſhalt loſe thy patience, thy charity, thy piety, and coming home ſhalt find thy ſelf much worſe and weaker for going abroad: He did not bid thee goe and ſwear, and quarrel, and ſcoff, or abet theſe things in others, but he did as bad: for theſe are the fruits, yea the beſt fruits that come from lewd and unthrifty company.</p>

One Serpent ſuffered to come ſo near as to winde about a mans hand, is not eaſily ſhaken off. The beginning of ſin is death, and a bad beginning brings on a worſe end.</p>

But wee muſt know that Chriſt took upon him a true human body, and the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, in which he was obnoxious to all our infirmities, only ſin excepted.

<note place="margin">Chriſt took not all infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of every particular man, for three cauſes.</note> for 1 Some ariſe of particular cauſes, which could not be in Chriſt; as namely, ſome hereditary infirmities and diſeaſes, as the Leproſie, Falling-ſickneſs, Stone, &amp;c. ſome from redundance of matter in generation have ſome monſtrous or ſuperfluous part: ſome from defect want ſome part, or have ſome part withered or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. None of this can agree to <hi>Chriſts</hi> moſt perfect conception of the Holy Ghoſt. 2 Some infirmities are acquiſite, as by Surfeits, Feavers, and Gouts by fulneſs: Theſe could not befall Chriſt, who never exceeded the mean, his whole life being a continual exerciſe of ſobriety: neither had hee ever any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite infirmity, but voluntarily undertaken. 3 Some defects and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are the fruit of ſome ſpecial judgement of God; as <hi>Uzziah</hi> his Leproſie was a ſpecial ſtroke of Gods hand for a ſpecial ſin: ſo ſome are born fools and ſimple: Neither could theſe belong to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who had no ſin, nor cauſe of judgement in him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to take upon him all natural and indetractable infirmities (as the School-men call them) and only them: <hi>Natural,</hi> that is, ſuch as follow common nature, infirmities common to all men: And <hi>indetractable,</hi> or incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, which detract not from the perfection of his perſon, nor of his grace, nor of the work of our redemption.

Note the wonderful Humility of our Lord Jeſus, who would not onely take upon him our nature, but even our infirmities, and was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man, but a ſervant alſo. If hee had deſcended, being the Lord of Glory, to have taken the nature of Angels, or (if of man) ſuch as <hi>Adam</hi> was in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, it had been admirable humility, and ſuch as hath no fellow: But to bee a worm rather than a man, is lower than humility it ſelf.

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2 His infinite love is herein ſet forth: hee was able to feed many thouſands with a few loaves and little fiſhes, yet hee would want Bread and bee hungry himſelf: hee could and did give legges to the Lame, yet he would bee weary himſelf for us: hee could fill the hearts of others with the joyes of Heaven, yet hee would ſorrow: he raiſed others from death, and yet he dyed.

Beſides, his experience giveth him much light into our weakneſſes, ſo as like a cunning angler, hee can bait his hook, ſo as hee hath experience the fiſh will take; and though hee ſee not the fiſh in the water, yet by his quill and cork hee can tell when hee is taken: So Satan hath for ſundry men ſundry baits, and can tell by the eye, hand, ſpeech, geſture, &amp;c. whether the man bee, or will bee taken.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The malice of Satan is ſuch, as it aimes directly at mans deſtruction; and therefore to get his deſire, and to have his prey, hee cares not how coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee ſets upon us, <hi>Gen</hi> 34.15. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> plotting the deſtruction of the <hi>Sechemites,</hi> perſwaded them to circumciſe themſelves, which they thought they would do to injoy <hi>Dinah:</hi> but even when they were ſore, they came moſt cowardly upon them, and deſtroyed them, in a curſed rage, as <hi>Jacob</hi> called it: Even ſo deals the Devil, hee comes when wee are leaſt able to reſiſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Satan well knows, that though hee can tempt us, yet hee cannot force us, and if hee overcome, hee muſt have help and ground from our ſelves, and therefore hee muſt obſerve for his advantage the time, place, perſon, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to mirth or ſadneſs, to wantonneſs or deſperation: his eſtate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rich or poor, high or low; his general corruptions and perſonal ſinnes, dealing no otherwiſe than the Philiſtims dealt with <hi>Sampſon:</hi> they intended miſchief againſt him, but hee was too ſtrong; now if they could watch a time when he was as weak as another man, &amp; know how to abate his ſtrength, they would not miſs of their end; but this they cannot know but by himſelf, and none can get it out of him but <hi>Delilah,</hi> who, if ſhee cut off his locks, his ſtrength is gone, and poor <hi>Sampſon</hi> is taken, his eies put out, and ſent to grind like a mill-horſe. So dealeth Satan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. As Satan watcheth all opportunities to miſchief us, ſo let us watch opportunities to reſiſt him. Shall a thief watch at midnight to rob thee and cut thy throat,
<note place="margin">Horat.</note> and wilt thou not watch to ſave thy ſelf? Now wee have time to arm and prepare our ſelves againſt the evil day: never had our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuch an opportunity for heavenly and ſpiritual things: Wee have an acceptable time, a day of ſalvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. a time of health and ſtrength, to gather a ſtock of grace and ſtrength againſt the time of weakneſs. Is it not now a point of wiſdome, if wee were as ſtrong as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to know that wee may bee weak as other men, and forecaſt a day of tryall? Shall we not bee worthily and ſhamefully foiled, if in this our day, while wee have means to gather knowledge, to increaſe in faith, and grace, wee lay not up for the day of weakneſs? will it not bee a gainful policy to acquaint our ſelves now with Satans policy aforehand, and with what weapons hee commeth againſt us, that ſo wee may arm our ſelves with armour of proof againſt his fiery darts, and learn ſo to reſiſt him, that hee may fly? And, not to do this, what is it elſe but to become traytors to our own hearts?</p>
                     <p>How unhappily and fooliſhly do men caſt off all this care to the time of weakneſs and ſickneſs, waſting all the time of their health and ſtrength in the world or other wretched courſes?
<note place="margin">Our ſick and dying day moſt unfit for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, for three reaſons.</note> Now they have the day, the light, the word, and Gods armory open to furniſh themſelves; but they caſt themſelves into the night, and lay all the hazard of the combate upon the day of ſickneſs or death; then they will ſend to the Miniſter, and think on death. But this is the unfitteſt time; For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 When the body is weak and ſick, it hath other things to think on, either the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40284:28"/> pain, or means of health, or to ſettle and diſpoſe the goods.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It is juſt with God, that they who neglect the means, when they may bee had, ſeldome have them offered at their deſire, but as it is <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. Becauſe I have called, and yee refuſed; yee ſhall cry, and I will not hear. And what comfort canſt thou have, if not in thy calling upon God?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Then Satan, becauſe wee are at the weakeſt, aſſails us with all his ſtrength and cunning, even to bring us to deſpair: and then how ſhall hee lift up his head, that never provided his armour of confidence, when hee ſhall ſee the roaring Lyons mouth wide open, and himſelf in his clutches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Let us learn of Satan to watch our own weakneſſes, and our perſonal corruptions: If the Devil ſo obſerve us, let us ſo much the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our ſelves. The enemy aſſaulteth the City where it is weakeſt, and there the wiſe Citizens lay moſt matter of defence. Here it will bee fit to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe rules.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Take heed wee wilfully caſt not our ſelves into infirmities,
<note place="margin">Five notable rules for the watch over our own weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> eſpecially ſinful, as, immoderately to deſire goods or gain. The feeding of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe coſt <hi>Judas</hi> deer: So the immoderate deſire of pleaſure, or ambitious purſuing of honour, or nouriſhing of wrath and anger, which is <hi>to give place to the devil,</hi> and brings forth manifold evils, as railings, revenges, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, murther, &amp;c. For if Satan by reaſon of natural infirmities, as hunger, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and the like, can take his advantage againſt Chriſt himſelf, much more can he work his advantage againſt us by ſuch immoderate and unruled paſſions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Play not with the objects of ſin: it is not without danger for the fiſh to play with the bait. Turn away thine eyes from beholding vanity, thine ears from hearing lewd things, ſhut the doors, and keep the threſhold of thy heart, make Gods fear the Porter of thy ſoul, let not death enter in at the windows of thy ſenſes, as <hi>Eve</hi> did. Delight brings practice, and repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a habit.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Watch thy natural deſires with all carefulneſs, becauſe in them a man is moſt frequent, and moſt impotent, and a thouſand to one thou falleſt by theſe. The natural deſire of meat and drink is ordinary, and as Satan here lay in ambuſh againſt Chriſt in them, ſo hee doth againſt all other men, good and bad. See wee not in the example of <hi>Eſau,</hi> that being weary and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry after his hunting, hee was ſo ſharp ſet, that hee made a moſt childiſh and graceleſs match? even for one meſſe of pottage hee did foregoe the birth-right, whereby hee had not onely title to an earthly inheritance, but to bee one of the Fathers and Patriarkes, and one of the promiſed ſeed, which prophanely, and not without too late repentance, hee rejected. Nay, wee want not examples of Gods dear children, who not watching their natural appetite, have been foulely foiled.</p>
                     <p>How did <hi>Lot</hi> ſuffer himſelf to bee drunken time after time? and then how ſtrongly did Satan aſſail him, and prevail againſt him to commit inceſt with his own daughters? It is a natural deſire to ſeek and lay together the things and wealth of this world; and herein how doth Satan ſtrive to bring in inordinacy upon every man? and who is hee that weakens not himſelf much, and gives advantage unto the Adverſary, by ſinful and inordinate deſires of riches? For this is a root of all evil, and <hi>thoſe that will bee rich</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) fall into diverſe temptations and ſnares.</hi> Whence our Saviour adviſeth us to take heed, that our hearts bee not oppreſſed with ſurfeiting, drunkenneſſe, or the cares of this life; with which many are become as drunk, as others with beaſtly quaffing. It is a natural deſire, for a man after labour of body or minde, to unbend and refreſh himſelf with ſome recreation or ſport: but here how doth the Devil watch, either to thruſt ſome unlawful exerciſe into mens hands? or, if lawful, to uſe them
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40284:29"/> unlawfully, waſting their time and goods, loving pleaſure and paſtime, or chooſing ſwearing, drinking, or idle company, and then they are preſently overmaſtred.</p>
                     <p>When did Satan ſet upon <hi>Peter?</hi> not ſo long as hee was among good company, of Chriſt or his fellow-Diſciples, whoſe preſence might have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him; but when hee runs among a company of rake-hells, and ſits him down among the High Prieſts ſerving-men by a warm fire, now hee is fit to bee wrought upon, and bee brought from denying his Lord, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear him, and from that, to curſe himſelf. Many ſuch knocks are they ſure to meet with, who turn themſelves out of their way and calling, and promiſcuouſly run into all companies, and all exerciſes, where God and Chriſt is not, but Satan and his inſtruments with a whole band of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Watch thy ſelf narrowly in thy outward eſtate, whatever it bee: for in all eſtates Satan hath his baits laid; and indeed few there bee that can uſe their eſtate aright. God gives a man proſperity, honour, and wealth in the World: here now is an opportunity to ſet forth the glory of God, to do good to others that need, and to further his own reckoning by being rich in good works, and laying up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time of need, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. but how doth Satan pervert it to bee an occaſion of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe of God, when hee moſt remembers us, to envy our betters and equals, to diſdain our inferiours, to miſchief our ſelves by ſecurity, preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pride, wantonneſs, and all riotous behaviour?</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, God diſpoſeth a mean and poor eſtate unto others: here is a fit opportunity to bring to a man the knowledge of himſelf, to train him up in humility, to whet up his prayers, to urge him to make God his portion, and to a diligent ſeeking of heavenly treaſures; to exerciſe his faith, patience, hope, diligence in his calling, and other graces. But Satan by his malice uſeth this as a ſmall opportunity to draw men to grudging, murmuring, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, deſpair, injuſtice, ſtealth, wronging men, and blaſpheming God. And all this comes to paſs, becauſe men have no care to learn S. <hi>Pauls</hi> leſſon, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. to bee full and hungry, to abound and to want, to be abaſed and to be advanced, and in every thing to be content. <hi>Job,</hi> when hee had loſt his goods and children, and was ſore afflicted, then the Devil ſet upon him by himſelf, and <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, to diſtruſt God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Keep thy watches in the performance of the parts of Gods worſhip: for even then (as here hee dealt with Chriſt, when by faſting and prayer hee had prepared himſelf to his miniſterial function, hee ſet on him) hee will aſſail thee: hee will bee with thee to keep thee from Church; and if thou muſt come for ſhame, hee will come with thee, to make prayers, preaching, and all unprofitable: hee came with <hi>Judas</hi> before Chriſt, ſo that all his holy doctrin was intercepted from his heart; the ſower ſowed good ſeed, hee ſowed Tares. Wee ſhall bee ſure of him, not onely when wee are idle as <hi>David,</hi> but when wee are beſt occupied: which is the cauſe, that when wee have moſt ſtrictly kept the Sabbath, and endeavoured our beſt, in all our duties publike and private, wee have much matter of humility; and this may ſerve as an hammer againſt ſpiritual pride.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Tempter]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing in the entrance of this adverſary, is his name, which is here changed; before hee was called a <hi>Devil,</hi> now a <hi>Tempter,</hi> but with emphaſis, <hi>That Tempter,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to diſtinguiſh him from other temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>God tempteth man,</hi> ſometimes by afflictions, which are called temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <hi>James</hi> 1.2. ſometimes by ſome ſpecial Commandement, as hee tempted <hi>Abraham:</hi> ſometime by occaſioning objects, as 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.11. God
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40284:29"/> ſends ſtrong deluſions, that is, objects enticing and deluding. But neither is this to tempt to ſin, nor a ſtirring up to it, but rather a proof what is in us, and a trial what we will doe; this is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>man tempteth God,</hi> when hee makes trial of Gods power and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, whether he can or will help or hurt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Wherefore doe yee tempt the Lord?</hi> this is by curioſity, preſumption, or diſtruſt; as <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>man tempteth man,</hi> by ſeeking matter and occaſion againſt an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to accuſe and reprehend: ſo the Phariſees and Herodians tempted Chriſt by captious and ſubtile queſtions, to bring him into danger: or by perſwading to ſin, as <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miſtris every day tempted him: But,</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>Satan is called a tempter by eminency,</hi> becauſe,
<note place="margin">Satan the moſt eminent and dangerous tempter.</note> 1 Hee was the firſt tempter to ſin, moving and ſtirring up <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in Paradiſe to ſin: <hi>an old Serpent.</hi> 2 He makes a trade of tempting; ever ſince it is his profeſſion, and no marvel if he be denominated from his profeſſion: he ſpends his whole time, policie, and ſtrength in tempting to evil, and the ſcope of all his actions is to bring men to ſin againſt God. As he begun betime, ſo he will continue as long as time laſteth. 3 He is the author or abettor of all other evil temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: for he tempteth not only by himſelf, but by his inſtruments; as <hi>Eve</hi> by the Serpent, <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Eve, Ahab</hi> by his Prophets. 4 He is furniſhed and ſtored with all arts to deceive: he can change himſelf into an Angel of light: he takes occaſion from our ſelves to ſeduce us, and lead us away by our own concupiſcence: he hath the world his faithful armour-bearer; in it hee hath falſe doctrin, hereſie, wicked counſel, wicked company, wicked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: on the right hand, wealth, honour, power: on the left contempt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, vain preſumption, and raſh confidence, deſpair, &amp;c. he hath all ſins that are near of kin to us.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is Satan thus reſtleſs in tempting?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe of his infinite malice; by which,
<note place="margin">Satan reſtleſs in tempting, for three reaſons.</note> ſeeing hee cannot hurt God, he ruſhes upon his Image in man. 2 Becauſe of his envie: that man ſhould climbe by Chriſt to that eſtate, which himſelf is fallen from irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. He would have him everlaſtingly unhappy like himſelf. 3 Becauſe of his ſpecial enmity againſt the godly: for all contraries tend to the deſtruction of contraries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If Satan be ſo reſtleſs a tempter, it behoves us ſo much the more to watch and pray againſt him: <hi>The former</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> commends unto us, that ſeeing our adverſary goeth about continually ſeeking to devour us, we muſt watch and reſiſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. If our adverſary were capable of end of days, or end of malice, we might be ſecure; or if he were wearied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ranging, or did take reſt or truce. But the Apoſtle tells us, that ſo long as there is a world, there ſhall be a Devil; and ſo long as he is a tempter, he will continually compaſs us, whatſoever we are about: if a good thing, to hinder it; as he ſtood at <hi>Jehoſhuah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> right hand: if an evil, to hatch, contrive, and thruſt it forward; and being done, to draw and ſpin out as much wickedneſs from it as may be. So where ever we be, wee are not without a tempter, at home or abroad, in the ſtreet or in the field, alone or in company, in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or recreations, in our eating and drinking, in our preaching or hearing, reading or praying, the Tempter ſpares no attempt againſt us. <hi>The latter</hi> our Saviour teacheth us, namely to pray that we be <hi>not lead into temptation,</hi> that ſeeing our enemy is mighty, ſubtile, and every way furniſhed for the aſſault, God would give us ſtrength to reſiſt evil, and perſevere in good ways to the end.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. It juſtly reproves their folly, who as if there were no tempter, are tempters of themſelves, care not what occaſions and weapons they miniſter to Satan; run into ſuch company and courſes, as if for want of Satans malice,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40284:30"/> they would lay ſnares and hooks for themſelves, that Satan may eaſily draw them to all evil. Of this ſort are they that haunt Ale-houſes and Taverns, ſeekers of exceſs, drinkers down of health and wealth, drowners of ſobriety and honeſty: what need this man any other tempter, that ſets himſelf to ſave the Devil this labour? yet, leſt he ſhould be alone in his ſin, he will fit him, and ſend in before or after him ſome ſwearer, or ſcorner, or Atheiſt; and they together ſhall ſwill in oathes, and ſcoffs, and impiety with their liquor, and notably confirm each other in lewdneſs and prophaneneſs.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſort alſo are they that watch the twilight to frequent laſcivious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or the houſes of light perſons, men or women; or the ſociety of ſuch as are foul in their ſpeeches, and wanton in behaviour; a ſecret poyſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth the heart hereby, and this is to ſeek the tempter: how hath he fenced himſelf with watching and prayer againſt temptation, that thus goes out to meet it? <hi>Joſeph</hi> fled theſe occaſions, and ran out of the company of his laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miſtris. Of this ſort are they that uſe wanton and light attire: and thoſe that goe to Maſs, and ſay they keep their hearts to God: and thoſe that ſet up Images before them, flat monuments of groſs Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſort are they that run to Enterludes and Playes, which are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils bellows, and blow no few ſparks into the gunpowder of our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. It was wont to be ſaid, that there was no play without a Devil; but there is never a one, but there is a great many more Devils than one, than ſeen; every part, perſon, action, ſpeech, and geſture almoſt, is a notable tempter and corrupter: what need theſe be driven of Satan, that thus run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him? Of this ſort laſtly are they, that ſeek to Witches and Sorcerers: theſe run to the tempter; as <hi>Saul,</hi> when God was gone from him, took great pains to goe to the Witch; yet he went in the night; but our Witch-hunters run in the day; the tempter need not come to them, they will find him if he be in any corner of the country.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This is a ſpecial uſe to Miniſters, to bee careful and watchful over their people againſt this tempter, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.5. The Apoſtle from this ground provoketh and teſtifieth his care over them: <hi>For this cauſe, when I could no longer forbear, I ſent to know your faith, leſt by ſome means the tempter have tempted you</hi> —. And how jealous was hee over the <hi>Corinths,</hi> 2 Corinth. 11.3. ſaying, <hi>I fear leſt as the Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through ſubtilty, ſo your mindes ſhould be corrupt from the ſimplicity of Chriſt?</hi> and having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt the inceſtuous perſon, that hee ſhould bee delivered to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to humble him, he writes in his ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.11. that they ſhould now receive him again, <hi>leſt Satan circumvent us, for wee are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his wyles.</hi> The Apoſtle knew there was a tempter that did mightily and continually aſſay, to bring in corruption of doctrin and manners; that would hinder them from the Word, and choak it in them; and therefore he was the more careful.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſhould every good Shepheard watch his Flock againſt this ravening Wolf, and reſide and abide with them as he is ſure the tempter doth. How unſafe and deſtitute are many people left to the tempter by the abſence of them, who have taken their charge, is plain by the Parable of the tares; that when the Husband-man ſlept, the envious man ſowed tares: hee ſlept a little and ſlumbred, but he was preſent: and if the tempter take the advantage of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle negligence in the preſence of a Paſtor, how will hee beſtir him in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? what an harveſt of tares muſt be reaped by that? It is ſure the tempter will not bee abſent, neither moneth, nor quarter; and therefore the Paſtor had need, not only to be ſtill preſent, but alſo watchful, to eſpy the ſtate of his people, to help them out of ſin, and teach them to reſiſt the tempter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. Beware of tempting any to evil, or of with-drawing any from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40284:30"/> good: for this is a Satanical practice. Our Saviour Chriſt, when <hi>Peter</hi> diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Come behind mee Satan:</hi> in which words hee ſhews, that none can tempt to evil, or from good, but Satan, or one led by him. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Elimas,</hi> who ſought to diſſwade the Governour from the faith, <hi>the childe of the Devil, Act.</hi> 13.10. becauſe, as Chriſt ſaid of the Jews, his works hee did. What a number of Devils are now in the World, continual inſtruments of wickedneſs, alluring and drawing men from God and goodneſs? yea, their Trade is to allure unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as thoſe that draw men to ſtrumpets, and are bawds to that filthy ſin; ſo to Ale-houſes, and there provoke them to drink, and to exceſs; Thoſe that draw men to ordinary gaming houſes; ſuch as ſtir up mens ſpirits to revenge; ſuch as with-draw men from Gods houſe, and good exerciſes; ſuch as diſſwade from Religion and ſtrict courſes; ſuch as commend onely looſe and diſordered mates for boon companions. In all theſe the ſpeech is true, <hi>Homo homini daemon,</hi> one man plaies the Devil with another. All of them are plain devils incarnate, tempters, and as the devils company is to bee avoided, ſo is theirs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. That wee may bee moſt unlike unto Satan, wee muſt bee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally provoking and moving one another to love and good works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. and exhort and edify one another, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.11. Every Chriſtian muſt by holy example, and holy admonition, bring one another forward in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: if they bee weak, to confirm them; if ſlow, to provoke and quicken them; if aſtray, to revoke and recall them. Hereunto conſider theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>

<note place="margin">Four motives to ſtir up one another to good, as Satan doth to evil.</note> and bee more diligent to help one another to Hell, than wee to ſet forward Gods work, and help one another to heaven?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Conſider</hi> the bonds between us and our brethren: 1 The <hi>bond of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> all are one mold, and one fleſh, and the Law of nature binds us to pitty and releeve their bodily wants, and much more their ſouls, if wee can: If their beaſt lay under a burden, thou wert bound to help it up; but thy brothers ſoul is under the burden of ſin. A good <hi>Samaritan</hi> will not paſs by the wounded man like the Prieſt and <hi>Levite,</hi> but will ſtep near him, and have compaſſion on him. 2 The <hi>bond of the Spirit,</hi> which yet ties us nearer: for if wee muſt do good to all, much more to the houſhold of faith: this bond makes Chriſtians to be of one body, and therefore, as members of one body, to procure the good and ſalvation one of another: they are children of one father, brethren in Chriſt, who have one faith, one hope, one food, one garment, and one inheritance: will one member refuſe to impart his help, his life, his motion, and gifts to another?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Conſider</hi> the excellent fruit that enſueth this godly care of provoking one another to good: hee that converteth a ſinner from going aſtray, ſhall ſave a ſoul, <hi>James</hi> 5.20. and the fruit of the righteous is as a tree of life, and hee that winneth ſouls is wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>Conſider</hi> theſe dull and backſliding times, full of deadneſſe and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherein wee ſee a general decay of zeal, love, delight in the Word, ſin bold and impudent, and piety almoſt aſhamed of her ſelf and name. Ah wee have great cauſe to quicken one another; as Travellors will call forward the weary and faint, and encourage them both to ſpeed and perſeverance; and as ſouldiers will animate and incourage one another againſt the common enemy: ſo muſt wee in our ſpiritual fight againſt ſin and Satan.

                        <note place="margin">Satan cometh to a man two waies.</note> I Anſwer, Satan commeth two waies: 1 <hi>Inwardly,</hi> and more ſpiritually, and that either by ſuggeſtion, troubling the heart and underſtanding; and thus hee put into <hi>Judas</hi> his heart to betray his Lord, <hi>John</hi> 13.2. or elſe by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion worketh upon the phantaſy. 2 <hi>Outwardly,</hi> and corporally, either by ſome inſtrument; as to Chriſt by the <hi>Scribes, Sadduces, Herodians,</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> or elſe by himſelf in ſome aſſumed bodily ſhape.</p>
                     <p>Now after what manner was Chriſt tempted?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer: Howſoever ſome good men think Chriſts temptation was onely in motion inwardly, and not externally and viſibly; yet I think it was chiefly externally, and in a bodily ſhape aſſumed.</p>
                     <p>Their Reaſons for their opinion are two: 1 Becauſe in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Devil ſhewed Chriſt all the Kingdomes of the world in a moment, which to do in a corporal manner were impoſſible; and therefore it was but in motion and cogitation. But that is but to inſiſt in the queſtion; and when God ſhall bring us to that place, wee ſhall ſee that even this was done really, and not only in imagination.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Reaſon</hi> out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.19. where it is ſaid, that Chriſt was tempted in all things like us: now (ſay they) our temptations bee inward by cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſuggeſtions: and therefore ſo was his. But this is much weaker than the former: for if hee were in all things tempted like unto us, it is plain hee was externally tempted as wee bee; <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Sathan</hi> in the external ſhape of a Serpent, <hi>Saul</hi> by Satan in <hi>Samuels</hi> ſhape; and it is the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of witches, that their ſpirits appear in an external ſhape of cats, mice, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Our reaſons which probably conclude the contrary (for it is no fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal point, neceſſarily and ſtiffely to bee held, becauſe the Scripture is not plain in it) are theſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">

                     <p n="3">3 Some good Divines make difference between Chriſts temptations and his members, which giveth good light in this queſtion; that whereas our temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are chiefly inward, becauſe they finde good entertainment in us (our diſpoſition being like a mutinous City, that is not only beſiedged with ſtrong enemies without, but with falſe traytors within, ready to betray it) contrarily, Chriſts temptations, if not onely, yet chiefly are external, preſented by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward voices and objects to his outward ſenſes; but preſently, by the perfect light of his minde, and unchangeable holineſſe of his will, diſcerned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, that they could not get within him, and much leſſe to bee moved and affected with them.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:40284:31"/>4 This is an Hiſtory, wherein the letter is ſo far to bee kept as it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Analogy of faith, or true interpretation of other ſcriptures: But that Satan ſhould come bodily, or aſſume a ſhape, is not againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but confirmed in the example of <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Samuel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it bee further asked in what bodily ſhape hee came, here I am with the ſcripture ſilent. Onely hee came not in a Monkiſh habit (as the groſs Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay) becauſe there was no ſuch in uſe in the world then, nor many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after. And yet it is obſervable,
<note place="margin">Note.</note> that themſelves think this habit the fitteſt for the Devil, as indeed it hath been ſince proved: for never did the devil in any habit ſo prevail againſt Chriſt in his members, as in this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian weed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Note hence what moved Satan thus to <hi>come,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chriſt came led of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Satan comes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> namely his own volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motion and will, hee <hi>came</hi> unſent for: <hi>Chriſt comes not but led of the Spirit, Satan comes of himſelf.</hi> And the ſame difference is to bee obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them that are led by the Spirit of God, and by this unclean Spirit. Thoſe that are led by Gods Spirit, whatſoever they bee about, they will look to the motion, what warrant they have for it, whence it is, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it tends, whether they bee led, or undertake things of their own head: they look whether the thing bee good in it ſelf, whether good in them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient in circumſtances, whether it belong unto them: and hence they do it cheerfully, and with a bleſſing on it.</p>
                     <p>Whereas whom Satan carries, they look for no warrant, they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on work, and execute their own luſts, humours, and deſires; yea, in the things they do beſt, they look for no warrant, and therefore, if it bee in any thing that is good, every thing is begun as with a left hand; they are without bleſſing and protection. See this difference between <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let us go up to Ramoth Gilead,</hi> but <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> ſaid, <hi>I pray thee let us ask Counſel of the Lord;</hi> and was there not as much difference in the iſſue? yes, <hi>Ahab</hi> was ſtrangely ſlain, a mighty man by chance drawing a bow, hit into a joynt of his armour, and ſlew him: but <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> was marvellouſly delivered. And therefore look to your warrant in your actions, ask your hearts whether you bee led by the Spirit, or <hi>come</hi> of your ſelves: and then you <hi>come</hi> of your ſelves, when either you have no word, or attempt any thing againſt the word, ſeeing Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Word croſs not one another, and one never directs but by the other. So if you bee croſſed in your actions or attempts, caſt an eye back to that which moved you to it, or whether you went by warrant, or upon your own head. If you have gone, and the Spirit not leading you, what could you expect but to bee croſſed? Look on the ſeven ſons of <hi>Sceva, Act.</hi> 19.16. who would take in hand to caſt out Devils in the name of Jeſus; but being not led by the Spirit, the evil Spirit took advantage on the want of their Commiſſion, and ran upon them, and overcame them, and prevailed againſt them, ſo that they fled out naked and wounded.</p>
                     <p>Note 2. <hi>Obſerve the impudency and boldneſs of the Devil that thus viſibly comes againſt Chriſt.</hi> Had hee not heard the voice from heaven? or had hee forgot it whileſt it yet ſounded? no, hee begun all his temptations thus, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> Or did hee doubt that hee was the Son of God?

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 God in juſtice beſotted him, that againſt his knowledge hee
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40284:32"/> ſhould encounter Chriſt for his own overthrow. 2 Though hee knew, that Chriſt was hee that ſhould break his head, and that hee could not prevail againſt him; yet his malice made him fearleſſe, hee would ſet upon Chriſt, whatſoever ſhould bee the iſſue, himſelf could bee but condemned. 3 He would againſt his knowledge ſhew his malice to God in moleſting and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his bleſſed Son: for here, and daily hee ſinneth the ſin againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. 4 God having him in chains, ſo over-ruled his malice, as it ſhould bee turned againſt himſelf; and bee a means to proclaim Chriſt in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the promiſed ſeed who had broken his head.</p>
                     <p>Hee which thus emboldned himſelf to come againſt Chriſt, will not fear to come to thee, bee thou as juſt as <hi>Job,</hi> yea, wert thou as innocent as the Lamb of God. It is Gods great mercy, that hee comes not ſo bodily and viſibly to us as to Chriſt: wee know, if God give him leave, hee can poſſeſs even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our bodies, as appears in all thoſe demoniaks: hee can aſſume a body alſo to terrifie or delude us with all, if God ſuffer him, as wee ſee in <hi>Sauls</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. So in Gods juſt judgement, when men give up Gods ſervice, and undertake to bee agents for Satan, hee gives power to the Devil to come to them in a bodily ſhape for his better familiarity with them, as to witches, and the like. It is Gods mercy that hee comes not thus as hee did to Chriſt, ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily as hee hath done in ignorant and Popiſh times; and wee muſt pray, that even in viſible ſhapes hee may neither terrify, nor delude, nor grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with us. But the light of the Goſpel hath forced him to come to us more ſecretly and ſpiritually, by wicked motions and ſuggeſtions, partly from himſelf immediately, and partly mediately from others.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing wee cannot hinder his comming to us; wee muſt bee ſo much the more watchful, that when hee comes, hee may find us prepared againſt him. For as wee cannot hinder birds from flying in the air, but wee may hinder them from making neſts on our heads: So wee cannot hinder the flying motions of Satan, but wee need not ſuffer them to ſettle in us.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Two certain rules to know when the tempter comes.</note> 
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By obſerving theſe two rules: 1 Whenſoever thou art perſwaded to any thing that is evil, then thou maieſt know the Tempter comes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee perſwades to ſin by extenuating it, why, it is but a little one, a grain, as light as a feather; <hi>now comes the Tempter:</hi> Gods Spirit never perſwades that any ſin is little. Sometimes by the utility and commodity of it; Oh it is profitable, by one oath or lye thou maieſt bee a great gainer, and why ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou bee ſo nice? but now <hi>the Tempter is come:</hi> for the holy Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thee <hi>not to ſwear at all, nor to lye for Gods greateſt advantage,</hi> much leſs thine own, <hi>and what profit is it to win the world with the loſs of ones ſoul?</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the pleaſure of it: wilt thou defraud thy ſelf of thy pleaſure? is it not as ſweet as hony? why, thou art but young, thou mayeſt game, and ſwear, and drink, and bee wanton: now thou haſt an occaſion of luſt, take thy time, thou canſt not have it every day. But here the <hi>Tempter is plainly come:</hi> for the Spirit of God would wiſh thee to <hi>remember, that for all theſe things thou must come to judgement;</hi> and that neither <hi>adulterers nor whoremongers ſhall enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> Sometimes by removing the puniſhment and terror; Why, who ſees? God is merciful, and eaſily intreated; you are a Chriſtian, and <hi>no condemnation is to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance wipes off all ſcores. Here the <hi>Tempter is come:</hi> For Gods Spirit ſaith, <hi>There is mercy with thee that thou maieſt bee feared:</hi> and, <hi>there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> but withall <hi>which walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Rule.</hi> When thou art diſſwaded from any good belonging to thee, <hi>the Tempter commeth;</hi> who as hee can make vice ſeem beautiful, ſo vertue to ſeem
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40284:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> ugly. Hee can diſſwade men from Religion in great friendlineſſe: 1 <hi>From</hi> a ſuppoſed impoſſibility; How canſt thou (poor weakling) bear ſuch a yoke? certainly thou wilt never indure ſuch ſtrictneſſe, thou mayeſt ſet thy hand to the plough, but thou wilt ſoon look back, and prove an Apoſtate. But here <hi>is a Tempter come:</hi> for Gods Spirit teacheth otherwiſe, that howſoever <hi>without Chriſt wee can do nothing,</hi> yet <hi>it is God that beginneth and perfecteth his good work in us,</hi> whoſe <hi>yoke is eaſy, and his burden light.</hi> 2 <hi>From</hi> the great trouble and ſmall neceſſity of it, from the diſgrace it carries among men, and the contempt of ſuch as preach and profeſs it. Here <hi>is the tempter come:</hi> for the Spirit of God teacheth, that hee that denies Chriſt before men, ſhall bee denyed of him before men and Angels.</p>
                     <p>Further, hee can diſſwade from diligent hearing the word, and from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, becauſe they bee exceeding long, and hard to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Why, thine own buſineſſe is ſuch as cannot give thee leave ever to attain any thing to the purpoſe, eſpecially becauſe deep knowledge of points belongs not but to Divines; for an unlettered and private man a little knowledge is beſt. Here is a <hi>Tempter come:</hi> though hee ſhould ſpeak in the voice of an Angel: for Gods Spirit bids private men <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, becauſe they teſtify of Chriſt;</hi> and commends private Chriſtians, becauſe they were full of knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Further, hee can diſcourage the practice of piety, by ſuggeſting, that to bee ſtrict in life is to ſavour of too much purity, at leaſt it will bee counted but ſcrupulouſneſſe and too much curioſity: and, if thou wilt bee ſingular, and contemn, and condemn all men but thy ſelf, ſo will men deal with thee: Why, thou liveſt as though men were to bee ſaved by good works, and not by Gods mercy. Here <hi>the Tempter is come:</hi> for the Spirit of Chriſt <hi>never quenched ſmoaking flax,</hi> but incouraged the care of walking in Gods waies, though it bee to walk in <hi>the ſtraight way, and narrow path that leadeth unto life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, in all outward or inward temptations, let us look to Chriſt, who hath ſenſe of both, that hee might bee compaſſionate to us in both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If thou bee the Son of God, command theſe ſtones to be made bread.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this firſt and fierce aſſault, conſider two things: 1 The ground of it,
<note place="margin">Satan aimeth at four things in this firſt temptation.</note> 
                        <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> 2 The inference, <hi>Command theſe ſtones to be made bread,</hi> which is on a good ground to intice him to evil. In which temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Satan aims at four things directly. 1 To impugn Gods truth, and word, and that notable oracle from heaven, teſtifying that Chriſt was the Son of God. 2 To ſhake the faith of Chriſt: Satan knew well enough hee was the Son of God, and hee makes not this a queſtion, as though hee would bee inſtructed in it; but that hee would make Chriſt doubt whether hee was the Son of God. And note how cunningly hee ties his policies together, as hee did againſt the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> hee calls Gods word into queſtion, which is the ground of faith; which if hee can bring out of credit, faith failes of it ſelf. 3 Becauſe of his preſent eſtate, to doubt of his fathers providence; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his great hunger and want of means to ſupply it, to call his own Divinity into queſtion. 4 To uſe unlawful means to releeve and ſuſtain himſelf.</p>
                     <p>In theſe particulars, ſtandeth the drift of the temptation. As for that which the Papiſts generally ſay, that it was to bring Chriſt to the ſin of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, by which (they ſay) the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> fell; there is no ſenſe ſo to think: For 1 Chriſts Anſwer, which was directly fitted to the ſuggeſtion, tended nothing to the ſin of gluttony. 2 Gluttony is an exceſſive eating of more than needs; whereas Satan deſires no more than that Chriſt would at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire eat, to the neceſſary ſuſtaining of nature: it is no great gluttony to eat a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40284:33"/> piece of dry bread in extream hunger; belly-gods and gluttons ſatiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with other more pleaſant and delicate diſhes. Let us therefore know that the proper end of this temptation, is diſtruſt in God, in his word, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and due means to relieve his preſent eſtate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If thou bee the Son of God]</hi> that is, the natural Son of God, equal in power, the delight of the Father, as the voice pretends, then do this that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve thee; elſe deceive not thy ſelf, becauſe of the voice from heaven, thou art but a pure man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Satan directly oppoſeth the word of God.</note> Doct. 1. <hi>Note how Satan doth directly oppoſe himſelf againſt the word of God.</hi> God had ſaid Chriſt was his Son, Satan knew it, and after confeſſed it; yet againſt his own knowledge hee calls it into queſtion, although hee had ſeen it confirmed by two ſtrange ſignes from heaven, of which wee have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The like was his practice, when hee ſet upon <hi>Eve,</hi> ſaying, What? hath God ſaid thus and thus? why, hee knew God had ſaid it, and that in the day they ſhould eat, they ſhould dye: and yet hee labours to make them doubt of that truth, which both hee and they knew too well. This was ever his practice.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 Hee hateth the word of God, becauſe it is the greateſt enemy to his Kingdome, every way reſembling God the author, and carrying his image. It is light, and no marvel if the Prince of darkneſſe reſiſt it; it diſcovers his ſubtilties, and fenceth the Chriſtian againſt his policies; it diſcerneth ſpirits, that let him come as an Angel of light, hee ſhall bee uncaſed. As hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth in darkneſs, ſo hee worketh in impurity; now here the word reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling God himſelf croſſeth him; it is pure in it ſelf; and a purifyer, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Yee are clean by my word.</hi> Further, his chief power being in the Sons of diſobedience, and in the hearts of infidels, here alſo the word clips his wings, being the word <hi>of faith:</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 17.20. Chriſt prayed not onely for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but for all thoſe that ſhould beleeve in him <hi>by their word.</hi> In a word, ſeeing hee exerciſeth his chief power in the ſons of perdition, who are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to rule at his will, here the word is his enemy, becauſe it convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſinners, and ſaveth ſoules, called therefore <hi>a word of ſalvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 He oppoſed Gods word through the malice he beareth Gods children: for hee ever oppoſeth true profeſſors, caſts them into priſon, and would never let them have a good day in the world, if hee might have his will, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them with temptations, and with outward afflictions. But this is the ſword of Gods mouth, and the ſword of the Spirit, by which they cut thorow his temptations, and make them forceleſs: it is that which comforts them, and ſuſtains them in their troubles, and directs them happily to heaven, ſo as no way he can have his will of them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It ſtands him in hand to oppoſe Gods word: for his long experience hath taught him, that ſo long as men hold to the word, they bee ſafe enough under Gods protection; and hee could never win his Captain-ſinners to ſuch high attempts in ſin, were it not that hee had firſt ſhaken the truth of Gods word out of their hearts. How could hee have brought <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy againſt God and his people, as to ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> and <hi>I will not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40284:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> let Iſrael goe:</hi> but that he had brought the word in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> mouth into contempt, further than the ſting of the miracles forced him. When <hi>Saul</hi> had once caſt off the Word of the Lord, Satan lead him as in a chain, to hunt <hi>David,</hi> to throw a dart at <hi>Jonathan,</hi> to ſeek to the Witch, againſt whom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had enacted a ſevere law. The like of <hi>Ahab, Herod, Nero, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5 The Word of God is the ſentence and rule of righteouſneſs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth Satan; and therefore no marvel if he cannot endure it, and wiſh it falſe, and love it no better than the bill of his own condemnation, and death eternal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> It is a note of a man foyled by the temptation of Satan, and of a devilliſh ſpirit, to call Gods Word into queſtion; either to deny it as falſe, or doubt of it as uncertain; either of which if Satan can perſwade unto, he hath his wiſh: for he knows they are no ſubjects to God that will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Scepter, but doubt of the rod of his mouth: he can eaſily blind-fold them, and lead them whither he will, that deny the light: hee can eaſily van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh them, and lead them captive to all ſin, if he can get them to caſt away their weapons.</p>
                     <p>Yet what a number of men hath the Devil thus farre prevailed with, in this violent kind of temptation? Some call in queſtion whether the Scripture be the Word of God, or no; ſwarms of Atheiſts, and Machevillians, that hold the Word but an human deviſe and policy; which is to open a door to all carnal and brutiſh Epicuriſm, and to confound man and beaſt together. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doubt not of all, but of ſome Books: and others not of ſome Books, but of ſome places of the holy Scripture. But we ſee that Satan would have Chriſt, but to deny or doubt of one ſentence: and what <hi>Eves</hi> calling into queſtion of one ſpeech of God brought on all our necks, all we her poſterity feel. And it is in our natures, when God ſpeaks plainly againſt that ſin, we make <hi>ifs,</hi> and <hi>pervadventures</hi> at it, and ſo turn it off. As for example:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Our Saviour teacheth plainly, that whoſoever are of God hear his Word, and his ſheep hear his voyce. Either men muſt beleeve it, or deny it: and yet how few can we perſwade conſcionably to hear the VVord? all who muſt plainly either make the voyce of Chriſt falſe, or themſelves none of Gods, none of Chriſts ſheep, for not hearing it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Our Saviour ſaith expreſly, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me,</hi> Luk. 10.16. and that God ſpeaks in the mouthes of his Miniſters, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. and that they have an heavenly treaſure in earthen veſſels. But how few are of this mind? never did any Heathens ſo deſpiſe the voyce of their Prieſts, and the anſwer of their Oracles, as Chriſtians in general deſpiſe our voyce, in which God and Chriſt profeſs they ſpeak.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Chriſt plainly ſaith, this word is the immortal ſeed of our new birth, the ſincere milk to nouriſh the ſoul, the bread of life, heavenly food. But who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him? for generally men have no appetite, no deſire to it, and can well be content to let their ſouls languiſh in grace, and be ſtarved to death. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they would goe as farre or farther into other Countries, as <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Sons into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when there was no Corn in <hi>Canaan,</hi> to ſupply their bodies with food, this they will not ſtirre out of their doors for.</p>
                     <p>VVell, take heed of calling Divine truths into queſtion,
<note place="margin">No Divine truth to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for three reaſons.</note> ſtand not in them upon thy reaſon and underſtanding, which are but low and ſhallow, ſuſpect them in things thou canſt not reach rather than the truth of Scripture, and make good uſe of theſe rules. 1 In the riſing of any ſuch temptation, know, that Satan ſeeks advantage againſt thee, and would bring thee into the ſame condemnation with himſelf, by the ſame ſin and malice againſt God. If hee durſt thwart ſo Divine a truth, ſo ſtrengthned from Heaven, and that to Chriſts own face, he dares and will contradict Gods VVord to thee. 2 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40284:34"/> if thou ſuffereſt Satan to wreſt away the credit of any part of Divine truth, or the VVord of God, what ſhall become of all our religion, and the ground of our ſalvation; all which is laid upon the truth of the word, or all which our Saviour ſaith, that not one jot of it ſhall fail. 3 Know, that by yeelding a little to Satan herein, God in his juſtice may give thee up to ſuch ſtrong deluſions, as the Devil himſelf cannot be ſo beſotted as to beleeve. See it in ſome inſtances. Satan beleeves there is a God, and trembleth, ſaith S. <hi>James,</hi> and yet he ſo farre deludes a number, as their ſottiſh hearts ſay, <hi>There is no God,</hi> Pſal. 14.1. Satan knows there is a day of reckoning and judgement, as the Devils confeſſed, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> and yet he ſo beſotteth and blindeth others, that they make but a mock of all, as thoſe in <hi>Peter,</hi> who mocked and ſaid, <hi>Where is his coming?</hi> 2 Pet. 3.1. Satan knows, that God is all an eye, to whom day and darkneſs are alike: yet in tempting men to ſecret ſins, he will make them ſay, Tuſh, who ſees us? <hi>can God ſee through the thick cloud?</hi> The Devil knows, that God is juſt, and will not take the wicked by the hand; and yet he makes the ſinner beleeve his caſe is good enough, being a moſt graceleſs man; and makes one wicked man ſay of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as in <hi>Malachi, We count the proud bleſſed, &amp;c.</hi> The Devil knows, that he that goeth on in ſin, ſhall not proſper; yet he makes the ſinner, who turns from the word, to beleeve he ſhall proſper.</p>
                     <p>As this temptation aimed to overthrow the Word of God, ſo alſo the faith of Chriſt in that word, namely to bring him from his aſſurance that hee was the Son of God. Whence we may learn, that,</p>

                     <p n="2">2 All Satans temptations tend to break off the Covenant and communion between God and his children, and therefore muſt in ſpecial manner aim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt faith: for by faith we are made the Sons of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. and God eſpouſeth and marrieth us unto himſelf by faith, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.20. and by faith wee are brought into the grace by which we ſtand.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 He knows that faith is our ſhield, whereby wee both keep off the fiery darts of Satan, and quench the ſame, and that faith is the victory whereby we overcome the world: this is it that makes all his temptations forceleſs: for, though we have no power of our ſelves to withſtand him, yet faith gets power from Chriſt, and lays hold on his ſtrength, which quells all the adverſary-power of our ſalvation. We ſtand by faith, ſaith the Apoſtle; and Satan ſees the truth of Chriſts ſpeech, that the gates of Hell ſhall never prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. He hath reaſon therefore to labour to weaken it, and to root it (if it were poſſible) out of the hearts of men, and out of the world.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 All his temptations bend themſelves to cut off and intercept the courſe of Gods love, and his favours to his children: he burſts with envie at the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Saints. But unleſs he gain their faith, he cannot interrupt this; for by faith, as by an hand, we receive Chriſt himſelf given us of the Father, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.17. and with him all his merits, and all things belonging to life and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40284:34"/> of the Spirit, who dwells in our hearts: by faith we receive the hope and hold of our bleſſed inheritance hereafter, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.5. And whereas Satans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual drift is, to eſtrange God and us, faith only croſſeth him, by which wee have entrance and boldneſs to the throne of grace by our prayers, to ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God freely as to our Father, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. yea, to ask what we will, and obtain not only all corporal bleſſings good for us, but alſo the ſanctified and pure uſe of them; whereas the unbeleever corrupts himſelf in them continually.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Satan well knows, that faith is the ground of all obedience, without which the word and all Gods Ordinances are unprofitable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no pleaſing of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. in any thing: for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of faith, is ſin. Hath he not reaſon then to aſſay by all his ſtrength, to take this hold from us? Doth not he know, that the foundation being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, the whole building muſt fall, and the root overturned, all the tree and branches come down with it? Sever a man from his faith, he tumbles in impiety and unrighteouſneſs, he is odious to God in all things, Satan tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon him, and leads him at his will.

<note place="margin">No temptation, no faith.</note> (as they ſay) <hi>never had faith:</hi> for never had any man true faith, but it was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled moſt fiercely: never was faith laid up in the heart of any child of God, but the combate between nature and grace, faith and frailty, fleſh and ſpirit, was preſently proclaimed. <hi>Eves</hi> faith was won from her quickly: <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was mightily aſſayled, which becauſe in ſuch a combate he retained, hee was renowned and ſtiled <hi>the father of all the faithful,</hi> and faithful <hi>Abraham: Moſes</hi> his faith was ſhaken, and his great ſin was unbeleef: <hi>Job</hi> in his miſery was many ways aſſayled to diſtruſt God, as his words import, <hi>If hee kill mee, I will truſt in him ſtill:</hi> and Satans aym was, to bring him to <hi>blaſpheme God, and dye.</hi>

                        <hi>ſo ſhould we moſt labour in fortifying it.</hi> Policy teacheth men to plant the moſt ſtrength at that fort or part of the wall, where the enemy plants his greateſt Ordnance, and makes the ſtrongeſt aſſault. And nature teacheth us to defend all our parts, but eſpecially our head and heart, and ſuch like vital parts: the very Serpent will ſave his head ſo long as he can, by natural inſtinct, whatſoever become of other parts. Our chief fortreſs is our faith: we have no grace but is worth preſerving and ſaving; yet of them all, Faith is as it were the Head and leader, it ſends the vital ſpirits of heavenly life to the whole man. Let grace therefore teach us to ſave this grace, which is the heart of a Chriſtian, above all the reſt, and to beware of the leaſt prick or crack in it, which is dangerous. A man may receive great gaſhes and wounds in his arms, and thighes, or exteriour parts, and recover it well enough: not ſo in the heart or brain. Though thy comfort, joy, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea and fruits may fail, take heed thy faith, thy root fail not.

                     <p>And of all others let afflicted and humbled ſouls lay hold, and make uſe of this exhortation; for Satan doth with ſo much the more violence aſſault them, as he findeth it eaſier to prevail with them: for well he knows, that howſoever they heartily deteſt all other ſins, and much adoe he hath to bring them to his lure in other, yet their ſpirits being oppreſſed and wounded by the ſenſe of ſin, and Gods diſpleaſure for it, he findes them inclinable enough upon every trivial temptation to deſpair; and ſo makes a wide breach by their improvidence, watching narrowly all other things, but not that which they ought moſt of all, and which Satan moſt of all impugneth.</p>

And wee muſt not onely fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the audible, but alſo the viſible word, that is, reverently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably uſe the bleſſed Sacraments, which are ſignes and ſeals of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and our Faith. Thoſe that ſay they beleeve, and yet neglect the Word and Sacraments, deceive themſelves, for there is nothing to ſave, where is no means of ſaving. A man cares not greatly for an empty cheſt. Neither can faith ſtay where ſhe ſees not her ſelf reſpected. Oh take heed of Satans ſubtilty, who to hold men in infidelity with-holds them from viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to ſtarve mens ſouls intercepts their food: And in comming to the word, conſider the excellent promiſes that are made to faith, and take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of places which may batter the devils temptations to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef.</p>

It ſtands us in hand, if wee would ſtand againſt Satan in the day of Tryal, to take heed of admitting any thing againſt our conſcience; which the Apoſtle compares to a ſhip fraughted with precious wares, ſuch as faith, love, joy, with other graces: Now if wee crack our ſhip of conſcience, wee make ſhipwrack of faith and the other graces, which good conſcience had preſerved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Faith being the free gift of God, who is the author and finiſher of it; a means to ſtabliſh it, is fervent and continual prayer, as the Apoſtles knew well enough, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.5. ſaying, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith:</hi> and that good man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord I beleeve, help my unbeleef.</hi> Chriſt praies for the not failing of thy faith, wilt not thou pray for thy own?
<note place="margin">The leaſt faith can pray for more.</note> A ſpecial mark of the leaſt meaſure of faith, is, that it can pray for more.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes: for faith muſt bee where is no feeling, and may bee: one thing is the being of a thing, another the diſcerning of it. Doth not the ſun ſhine, though a cloud or ſome other thing bee between our ſight and it? Nay, then when ſenſe and feeling ceaſe, faith begins her chief and moſt glorious work. Was it not <hi>Abrahams</hi> commendation, that hee beleeved againſt beleef, and hoped againſt hope? when all nature and ſenſe was ſet againſt him, hee held the word of promiſe againſt ſenſe and nature. Nay, our bleſſed Saviour, in whom was no grudgings of infidelity, but aſſured faith in his Father, yet in reſpect of his preſent ſenſe and feeling cryed out, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken mee? David</hi> beleeved in the word of God, and not his eyes, and ſo muſt thou, that thou heareſt God ſpeak, and not that thou ſeeſt. <hi>Thomas</hi> when hee would beleeve no more than that hee ſaw and felt, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid to him, <hi>Bee not</hi> (ſo) <hi>faithleſs, but faithful.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 Becauſe of Satans malice to piety and religion, which by this means hee ſeeks to chaſe out of the earth: for the world keeps it under, and commonly it riſeth to no great matters.

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 Satan herein hath much ſtrength from our own corruptions, and plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth often with our own heifers: for we deſire rather to walk by ſenſe than by faith: we hardly beleeve without pawns and pledges; every man truſts his own eyes, and thinks <hi>wiſdom good with an inheritance.</hi> Hence this temptation finds the eaſier entrance and better entertainment.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Satan ever in theſe temptations hath a further reach than he ſhews, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he may hence perſwade men by ſome unlawful means to releeve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and better their eſtate; no longer to depend upon God, who hath caſt off the care of them; but to ſhift for themſelves, and (as hee moved Chriſt himſelf) to make ſtones bread.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Satan hath gotten no ſmall advantage againſt Gods dear children by this kind of temptation, and brought them to take their own ways, as if God had quite forgotten them. <hi>Abraham</hi> thought God had left him to the cruelty of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40284:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and that there was no way to help him, but by lying, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his VVife ſo to doe alſo. <hi>Lot</hi> was ſo invironed by the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> as to avoyd their fury he ſaw no way, but to offer his Daughters to their abuſe and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>David</hi> was ſo hunted by <hi>Saul,</hi> as hee muſt ſhift for himſelf by feigning himſelf mad. An heart now cleaving unto God, and reſting in his aſſured love and providence, would have waited till God had come unto it, and not turned it ſelf to carnal counſels.</p>

It is a deluſion of Satan, and general in the world, to make men deem themſelves and others happy, and in Gods favour, becauſe they proſper in the world, and Gods people infortunate, becauſe the world croſſeth them for the moſt part. For:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 By this concluſion Chriſt himſelf the Son of God,
<note place="margin">Outward things make neither happy nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy: four reaſons.</note> who had all his Fathers love poured upon him, ſhould have been moſt hated of his Father, and a moſt unhappy creature: He was in want of houſe, of money, of friends, of food; the world had no malice in it, which was not caſt upon him: and hee was not only forſaken of men, but in ſuch diſtreſs on the Croſs as he complained hee was forſaken of God. And yet all creatures were not capable of that love wherewith his Father loved him, when he loved him leaſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Neither the teſtimony of Gods love, nor the dignity of his Children ſtands in outward things, nor in the abundance of worldly comforts: for then the rich Glutton ſhould have been farre better than <hi>Lazarus; Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> who for famine were glad to fly their Country, ſhould be in leſs grace with God, than the wicked Kings to whom they went. The Apoſtles, who were the lights of the world, who were in hunger, thirſt, nakedneſs, buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted, without any certain dwelling place, reviled, perſecuted, accounted as the filth of the world, and the off-ſcouring of all things, ſhould have been in no better account with God than with men. The Saints in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36. to 39. who were tried by mockings and ſcourgings, by bonds and impriſonment, were ſtoned, hewn aſunder, tempted, ſlain with the ſword, wandred in ſheep-skins, &amp;c. being deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented, ſhould have loſt both their dignity in themſelves, and their favour of God. But they loſt neither of theſe: For the ſame text ſaith, that the world was not worthy of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of ſuch worth, and that by faith they received a good report, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, and all good men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The beauty of Gods children is inward: that which argueth Gods love, is the gift of his Son, faith, hope, a joyful expectation of the future inheritance, 1 Joh. 3.1. <hi>Behold what love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God.</hi> In which words, the Apoſtle calleth our eyes back from beholding earthly dignities and prerogatives, which we are ever poring into, and have Hawks eye to ſee into the glory of the world: But hee would have us behold Gods love in other things than theſe,
<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the love of God, as God, and of God as a Father.</note> namely in the inward notes and marks of Gods children. And here is a main difference between that love which comes from God as God, and that which cometh from him as a Father; between that which he beſtoweth on his enemies, and that which he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on his ſons; that which Bond-children receive, which are moveables, and that which the ſons of the free-woman receive: for this is the inheritance: let <hi>Iſaac</hi> carry that away, and no ſcoffing <hi>Iſmael</hi> have a foot in it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Whereas Satan from croſſes, loſſes, afflictions, anguiſh, and durable ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows perſwades that men are not Gods children, the Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 8.) makes a clean contrary argument, that afflictions and croſſes are ſigns of Gods love rather than of hatred, and marks of election rather than of rejection: <hi>Whomſoever the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth.

                     <p n="3">3 Hee eaſily draws on this temptation under of a colour of neceſſity, which wee ſay hath no law, but falſly. Hence is the common ſpeech of the world, to defend any injuſtice, Why? I muſt live, I muſt not put forth my wife and children to beg, I muſt ſo exerciſe my calling, as to maintain my wife and family, I muſt utter my wares, though I lye, and ſwear, and exact, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: and ſo under a colour of good, and pretence of neceſſity, no wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes amiſs in the courſe of ones trade.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This teacheth us to bewail the pittiful eſtate of numbers of men taken in this ſnare of the Devil: as,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Numbers of men oppreſſed with poverty, becauſe they ſay they muſt live; they muſt live in an unlawful calling, wherein they be ſlaves and drudges to every mans ſin: ſuch as are Players, Jeſters, Wizards, Tumblers: ſuch are Scholars, who for preferment run into Popiſh Countries, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſeminaries, and ſo become Traytors. Yea, thoſe that have no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, muſt live too: but how? by filching, ſtealing, or begging, as idle and roguiſh vagrants, and thoſe at home whoſe extream idleneſs, brings po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty upon them as an armed man. Or elſe by gaming, cheating, and by their wits. The whole courſe of all which, is but a prentiſhip to the devil.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Others that exerciſe honeſt trades, but eaſily help themſelves forward by ſwearing, lying, facing, falſe weights, meaſures, and trickes which they put upon men: They never ſtick for a penny-profit to hazard their ſouls: He is no quick Chapman, if hee cannot lye for advantage: neither can hee bee truſted unleſs hee ſwear: hee muſt ſwear, or hee muſt not ſell: hee muſt ſometimes make the beſt of an ill bargain, and with a little colour lay it upon another mans neck: for why ſhould hee willingly wrong or undo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Others a number, 1 who by miſ-demeanours have brought juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon themſelves, and ſeek to ſalve it by lying, facing, and ſhifting: and perhaps by worſe means. This was the caſe and ſin of good <hi>David,</hi> hee had corrupted himſelf with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> hee was afraid the adultery would come home to him, hee ſends for his worthy Captain <hi>Uriah</hi> to go home to his wife, that ſo it might bee covered; but when it could not that way, good <hi>Uriah</hi> muſt bee ſlain at <hi>Davids</hi> appointment, and ſo hee would hide adultery by murther. 2 Like unto theſe are thoſe, who having outragiouſly overſhot themſelves in notable riots by word or deed, and being called to account for it, lay all the blame upon drunkenneſſe, a ſin indeed of ſtrong burden, able to carry away many ſins upon it; but never was any ſin leſſened by another, but aggravated, and the excuſe is a confeſſion of a double ſin, which in all true judgement deſerves double puniſhment. 3 Servants, or children, who having committed a fault, hide it by lying, and ſo to avoid an inconvenience, run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a miſchief.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Others, being ſick and diſeaſed, are perſwaded and reſolved to go to Wizards, and Witches, cunning men and women, and ſo get releaſe by breaking the Priſon. A pittiful cure, when the Devil is the Phyſician. <hi>Saul</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40284:38"/> never went to the Witch, till God was gone from him. And take this for a certain concluſion; 1 Whoſoever goeth or ſeeketh to a Witch, in loſſes, croſſes, &amp;c. let him boaſt as much as hee will of his faith, it is but a Satanical faith, a faith in the devil, and not in God, by which the Witch workes all that is done. 2 The remedy is far worſe than the diſeaſe, ſeverely revenged on <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.13. and on <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.16. 3 The Devil hath got from them, that which hee could not from Chriſt; namely, to uſe another means of releaſe than God appointed.</p>
                     <p>Some there bee that are hearers of the Word, yet if they ſee any perſon extraordinarily viſited, will give him counſel to ſeek out to the cunning man. Is it becauſe there is never a God in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> is this a ſmall ſin? By Gods law they ought to dye that ſeek to thruſt a people from their God, and drive them to the Devil? <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.10. But this is a greater ſin than that. Miſerable comforters that wiſh them to go to Hell for help.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Let us carefully look to ſuch rules as may keep us from uſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable means, and they are four.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Conſider that all means outward and ordinary are but ſervants,
<note place="margin">Four conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to fence us from uſing unwarrantable means.</note> to which God hath tyed neither bleſſing nor providence, further than hee pleaſeth, that our affections ſhould not bee tyed to them, nor our eyes fixed on them, but on his hand who diſpoſeth means to his own ends. It was the ſin of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> to limit the <hi>Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> namely to means, that when they ſaw no means, they ſaw no God: whereas a heart looſed from the means, and rightly diſpoſed to the Author, doth not ſtint him neither to the <hi>meaſure</hi> of affliction, nor to the <hi>time,</hi> or <hi>means</hi> of deliverance. <hi>Job</hi> will not tye God to any <hi>meaſure,</hi> but commits himſelf wholly to him, ſaying, <hi>If hee kill me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> For the <hi>time</hi> of deliverance, the godly commit it to God, in whoſe hand times and ſeaſons are: the juſt man that lives by faith makes not haſte, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.28. For the <hi>means</hi> of deliverance, <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſecure of it, <hi>My ſon, God will provide:</hi> hee ſaw no means of the Promiſe, if <hi>Iſaac</hi> were offered, yet hee laies him on the alter, on the wood, and receives him from the dead.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Conſider, that any good thing is then beautiful, when it is compaſſed by good means. Satan ever aimeth at one of theſe two things,
<note place="margin">Satan ever ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to blemiſh that good which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder.</note> to hinder every thing that is good, or, if hee cannot do that, then to thruſt it on by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and ungodly means, that hee may at leaſt blemiſh that which hee cannot hinder: and, if hee cannot overtake us in the matter, yet to get beyond us in the manner of doing it. Wee muſt therefore watch in both theſe, that what wee do bee warrantable; as to preſerve our ſelves, and provide for our families: (Hee is worſe than an Infidel that doth it not) but withal know, that hee is no better than an Infidel, that doth it by evil means, or after an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable manner.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Conſider, that there is no neceſſity, if ordinary and lawful means fail, to uſe unlawful. When men ſay, I muſt live, and I muſt maintain my family; here remember, that <hi>muſt is for a King,</hi> nay, abſolute and unlimitted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is for the King of Kings. It is not abſolutely neceſſary, that thou live, but ſo long as God pleaſeth: yea, it is abſolutely neceſſary that thou rather periſh, and not live, then break Gods Commandement: If thou periſh for want of means, thou mayeſt go to heaven as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and exchange a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life with an happy: But if to keep thee from periſhing, thou looſe thy ſoul, this is <hi>to leap out of the pan into the coales.</hi> Thou therefore that muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for thy ſelf and thine, I tell thee, thou muſt do it by a moderate and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt care, warrantable by the word, and not ſhift and prole, as if all were fiſh that comes to the net: that is all the neceſſity that God hath laid on thee, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſuggeſted by Satan.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Labour to live the life of faith, which will exclude ſuch diſturſtful
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40284:39"/> thoughts and practices. For the property of faith, is,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">Three excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent properties of faith in want of means.</note> 1 To beleeve the promiſes of God, when we ſee the clean contrary; as, when we feel our own ſins moſt, then moſt to beleeve our own juſtification; out of the deep with <hi>David,</hi> yea out of the Whales belly with <hi>Jonah,</hi> and in darkneſs with <hi>Job</hi> to ſee light.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To ſee things inviſible, to make things abſent, preſent; yea God abſent preſent, and to ſet him continually at the right hand. <hi>Moſes</hi> feared not the wrath of the King, becauſe <hi>he ſaw him that was inviſible,</hi> Heb. 11.17. <hi>Eliſha</hi> being in <hi>Dothan</hi> feared nothing, when his ſervant cryed out; becauſe his eyes were open to ſee the Angels, as fiery Chariots protecting him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Faith is never ſo working as in perillous times, becauſe then there is moſt need, moſt uſe of it; then it ſets it ſelf a work, and mingles it ſelf with the promiſes of God, by which it quickens and puts life unto a man, when he is half dead, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Remember thy promiſe wherein thou haſt cauſed me to trust: it is my comfort in trouble: for thy promiſe hath quickned me.</hi> Now it beſtirres it ſelf, to make Gods faithfulneſs and truth his ſhield and buckler. Notable is that example of the three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 17. who were in preſent danger of their lives, and caſt into an hot Furnace: In this danger now their faith beſtirres it to provide for their ſafety, not by any yeelding, or blanching, or buckling to the unjuſt command; but by furniſhing their mouthes with a reſolute anſwer, <hi>Be it known unto thee, O King, that wee will not worſhip this Image;</hi> and by preparing their hearts (through their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, who was able to deliver them) rather to yeeld themſelves to the fire and raging flames, than to any part of that commandement. And were faith and Gods fear working in the heart, it would deſtroy falſe fears and infidelity, which Satan prevaileth in mightily, cauſing men to ſeek help by unlawful means, if the lawful bee never ſo little ſet out of ſight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Command theſe ſtones to be made bread.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is an inference upon the former words, <hi>If thou be the Son of God:</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a true ground Satan raiſeth a dangerous conſequence: Chriſt was the Son of God: true. Muſt he therefore needs make ſtones bread?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Satan inferteth miſchievous concluſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on true premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> Doct. <hi>It is an ordinary temptation of the Devil, to inferre miſchievous concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon true premiſes.</hi> God had no reſpect to <hi>Cains</hi> Sacrifice, as to <hi>Abels:</hi> Whereas now <hi>Cain</hi> ſhould have offered of the beſt, as <hi>Abel</hi> did; and have brought faith with his offering, by which <hi>Abel</hi> offered a better Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. Satan inferres upon it, <hi>Therefore kill thy brother. Saul</hi> received no anſwer of God: that was true: but that therefore he ſhould goe to the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> was Satans inference, both againſt the Law of God, and <hi>Sauls</hi> own law. God is a merciful God: a true premiſe, and the ſcope of all the Scripture: but, that <hi>Jonah</hi> ſhould therefore fly to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> and not goe to preach the deſtruction of <hi>Ninivie,</hi> was a Satanical inference. A man muſt pity himſelf, and doe what he can to repel evil from him, and avoyd danger: but that Chriſt ſhould therefore not goe up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſuffer, was a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence of Satan in <hi>Peters</hi> mouth; whom therefore Chriſt calleth Satan.</p>

                        </label> 1 Satan is cunning, and ſeeketh by mingling good and evil, truth and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to juſtifie that which is falſe, and to draw it on with the truth. If hee ſhould never ſpeak truth, he could never deceive half ſo much: therefore hee ſpeaks many truthes, to give credit to his lyes: and the ſame hee hath taught all his agents. Do we think, that a falſe teacher or heretick could doe any great hurt, if he ſhould not lay his leaven in a lump of truth? would not every man at firſt reject him, if he ſhould bring never a true doctrin? but therefore, that his hereſie may ſpread like a gangrene, he comes with a fair pretence of many
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40284:39"/> truthes which cannot be denied. Doe wee think, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have ſo prevailed in the world, or that Antichriſtian ſtate ſhould have been endured, or could any Papiſt bee ſuffered in ours or any well-ordered Country, if they did not colour all their abominations and falſe religion with ſome general truths; if they ſhould not in word and ſhew hold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Articles of faith and principles of our religion, concerning God in unity of eſſence and trinity of perſons, concerning Chriſt, the Church, &amp;c. were it poſſible, that any Chriſtian ſtate could bear them, while indeed and in truth they reverſe the whole foundation of religion, and are limbs of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? No, their deceit is a myſtery, and walks in darkneſs, and the mask and vizards of truth with pretence of holineſs, hath held the Swords of Princes from them, which elſe had long ſince been ſanctified in their overthrow.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Satan can doe no other, who cannot ſpeak truth for truths ſake: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Lyar from the beginning, he loves not truth, and therefore if hee ſpeak truth, it is to corrupt the truth, or to ſtabliſh ſome lye. <hi>Lying is the Devils mother tongue,</hi> Joh. 8. 1 Sam. 28.17, 18.
<note place="margin">Lying the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils mother tongue.</note> Satan in the habit of <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpake many truths; as, that the Lord had rent the Kingdom from him, and given it to <hi>David</hi> (becauſe he had ſo ſpoken hee would doe it; and becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> obeyed not the voyce of the Lord, nor executed his fierce wrath againſt the <hi>Amalekites:</hi>) and that the Lord would deliver him, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into the hand of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> the next day, &amp;c. But all this was to feed <hi>Saul</hi> in his deluſion, and hold him in his ſin, as though he were <hi>Samuel,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. the Lord hath done it, even as he ſpake <hi>by mine hand:</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. to morrow <hi>ſhalt thou be with me, &amp;c.</hi> So in the New Teſtament we have the Devils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſt to be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Holy One,</hi> the ſum of the Goſpel; and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to be the <hi>ſervants of the high God,</hi> Act. 16. but both Chriſt and his ſervants put them to ſilence, and would not have them to ſpeak the truth, becauſe it was to deprave and ſlander the whole truth, as though Chriſt and his ſervants had been in league and agreement with the Devils, and ſo their doctrin had been not Divine but Diabolical. Thus Satan like a Barge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man looks one way, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>owes another.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Satan ſees how our nature is eaſily carried away through a general ſhew of good or truth, to take in with it error and falſhood hand over head, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trial or diſcerning: For though our bleſſed Saviour would not confound ſtones and bread, yet we eaſily take ſtones with bread, and Serpents with Fiſhes. The whole Maſſe-book is but an heap of Idolatrous prayers, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: but yet becauſe there is ſome ſhew of good in it, many Scriptures, and ſome tolerable and good prayers, with many devotions, it is wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without trial, of millions given over to deluſion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Satan the Prince of darkneſs can transform himſelf into an Angel of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. and the falſe Prophets will be confident that the truth is with them: <hi>Zedekiah</hi> will oppoſe <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and <hi>Hanani</hi> will ſmite <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and make yokes againſt the King of <hi>Babels</hi> yoke, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.11. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> cryed out, that the ſound Chriſtians were Traytors to the holy Books, and themſelves the defenders of them. The Papiſts at this day cry out with <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> the heretick, I defend the opinions of the Fathers, and their whole doctrin is condemned with mine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Let us learn to be wiſe, and try before we truſt, not taking all things in groſs, but firſt examining and proving them: Falſe-hood carries often a ſhew of truth, and truth often covers falſe-hood: no vice appeareth in his proper colour, but under the likeneſs of ſome vertue. The Romiſh VVhore of <hi>Babylon</hi> offereth not her wine of Fornications in the bark of ſome poyſoned plant, or ſhell of ſome poyſonful or venemous Creature, but hath conveyed them all into a cup of gliſtering gold, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.4. and this hath entiſed the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40284:40"/> great ones of the earth, who gazed at the gliſter of the golden boul, but never looked what was in it: the glorious ſtile of Catholike Church, Vicar of Chriſt. <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, hath deceived ſuch as liked not to try before they did truſt: and ſo hath univerſality, antiquity, fathers, conſent, and the like. <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould have examined the words of the Serpent, and <hi>Adam</hi> the gift of his Wife; and then neither of them had been deceived. The builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> had they examined the motion before they had made onſet, had avoyded that confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have tried the counſel of <hi>Sarah,</hi> before he had taken her Maid into his boſome. This examination and trial by the touch-ſtone of the Word, will ſhew the inconſequence of ſuch dangerous concluſions. How lamentably are many great wits and gifts given over in Popiſh Countries for want of this ſound trial, taking their religion by tradition, offering to the ſhrines of their fore-fathers, that often they can ſpend their goods and lives for it, as though it were the only truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Let us labour to avoyd theſe common darts, theſe falſly concluded concluſions which Satan ſeeks to have us aſſent unto: It is a great ſubtilty of the Devil, by which he overthrows many, and muſt the more circumſpectly be watched againſt. See ſome inſtances of this his Stratagem, in matters of faith, and of practice.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">Falſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of faith.</note> I. In matters of faith: 1 In the Scripture it is a frequent ground, that God is merciful: true, therefore (ſaith Satan) be bold in ſin, and deferre thy repentance: thou maiſt repent when thou liſt. Here is a wicked inference in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: for there is mercy with God, that he may bee feared; and, Knoweſt thou not that the long ſuffering of the Lord ſhould lead thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It is a true ground, that Chriſt dyed, and that for all, <hi>i. e.</hi> elect and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. But Satan ſaith, Therefore what needeſt thou care? why ſhouldeſt thou be ſo preciſe? Is not Chriſt a ſufficient pay-maſter? Yes, but he paied for none, but for thoſe that walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is a true ground, that a man muſt provide for himſelf and his family, or elſe he is worſe than an infidel. Hence Satan collects, Thou mayeſt bee covetous, thou mayeſt ſcrape and ſcratch together any thing; an Infidel is the worſt in the world: and ſo he perſwades a man, that all is fiſh which comes to net, and any wind good that brings gain with it.</p>

In matters of practice, many ways: 1 Thou art the Son of God, then make theſe ſtones bread, thou mayeſt be a little bolder than other. God will not be ſo angry with thee. Here ſee a plain Satanical inference: For the child of God muſt honour his Father, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. and fear to offend him. If I by profeſſion draw near unto God, I muſt the more ſanctifie my ſelf, and grace my profeſſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If thou beeſt a man, a gentleman, a man of valour, doe not put up this wrong, but revenge this quarrel: elſe every one will point at thee for a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard. Here is another devilliſh concluſion; for a man muſt not ſtep into the place of God, who ſaith, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay:</hi> and a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt bee of gentle behaviour, not ſavage, fierce, and cruel: a man of valour muſt paſs by offences: <hi>It is the glory of a man to paſs by an offence, Prov.</hi> 16.32.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 If thou beeſt an honeſt fellow, drink, ſit bare upon the ground, and pledge ſo much to ſuch and ſuch a friend, drink a health to that and the other boon companion. But the inference is like the former: it warres with honeſty and civility, to drink and ſwill till health be drowned, and reaſon baniſhed, and the party ſorted with the brute beaſts.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 If thou beeſt a good Catholike, a true Romaniſt, defie theſe Hereticks, dye for the Romiſh religion; but before thou dyeſt kill thy Prince, cut the

If hee will live, he muſt eat. 5 That it is a glorious thing, to command <hi>ſtones:</hi> I ſay not <hi>Pray</hi> (for by prayer as great things as this have been done; the Sea dryed, fire turned into water, the Sun ſtaied in his courſe, to ſtand ſtill, yea and go back) but <hi>command</hi> by thine own proper power. 6 That it is a work of ſpecial uſe, not onely for the releef of thy ſelf in this want, but to ſatisfy mee; for if thou makeſt ſtones bread, I will confeſs the finger of God, and beleeve thy Fathers voice, that thou art the Son of God, and accordingly account of thee: and ſo ſhall all that ſhall come to the knowledge of this great and extraordinary work. 7 That it is not unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: to command a few ſtones to bee made bread, will bee no hurt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man; and if thou wilt not tranſubſtantiate many ſtones, turn but one ſtone into bread: ſo it is, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.3. <hi>Say to this ſtone that it bee bread,</hi> in the ſingular number; whereas it is probable, that at firſt hee offered him many, or all the ſtones in the place, which <hi>Matthew</hi> recordeth: if Chriſt think that too much, hee will bee content that hee turn but that one into bread, as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it. 8 The Son of God ſhould demean himſelf as the Son of ſuch a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is heir and Lord of all things: mee thinkes thy eſtate is not ſuited to thy perſon; and therefore by this action manifeſt that which thy eſtate doth not: and if thou doeſt not, give me leave to doubt of thy perſon, and take thee for an impoſtor.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Satan ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily moveth men to turn ſtones into bread.</note> Doct. <hi>It is an ordinary temptation of the Devil to ſhake the faith of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to move them to turn ſtones into bread:</hi> For as hee dealt with Chriſt in want, Chriſt was hungry, and the devil ſhews him ſtones, let him turn them into bread if hee will: ſo is it with men who are tempted in like manner, if they bee in want: Bread you muſt have, what need I tell you of ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a want? and therefore ſhift for your ſelf, here bee ſtones, at leaſt one ſtone in time of need, turn it into bread, why to help your ſelf you may uſe a little extraordinary or unwarrantable means. When Satan ſeduced <hi>Eve,</hi> hee perſwaded her to turn a ſtone, or rather an apple into bread: why? thou ſeeſt how God envies your full happineſs, and doeſt thou beleeve his word to bee true? No, no, it is but to keep you from being as Gods, which, what an excellent eſtate it is, you now know not. <hi>Eſau</hi> was very hungry when hee came from his hunting, and hee muſt dye if hee turn not a ſtone into bread: and as Satan never goes without his ſtones, that is, his objects, ſo there was a meſs of broath ready, for which prophanely hee ſold his birth-right: I am almoſt dead, and what is the birth-right to mee? <hi>Saul</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly haunted and vexed, and knew not what to do with himſelf; God was ſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40284:41"/> far out with him as hee anſwered him no way; and now hee muſt get him to another patron, and who is fitteſt for him, who is gone from God, but the Devil? Hee muſt now ſeek a familiar to anſwer him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.7. the ſtone is not far off, there is a Witch at <hi>Endor,</hi> and hee can eat no bread but from her hands.</p>
                     <p>There bee two eſpeciall reaſons or occaſions, whence Satan groundeth and followeth this temptation of turning ſtones into bread: 1 The avoiding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. 2 The procuring of ſome apparent good; both which hee knows our haſty inclination unto.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. In avoiding troubles hee layeth two ſnares, and hath two plots:
<note place="margin">Snares laid by Satan in avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> 1 To turn ſtones into bread, by uſing ſome unlawful means. <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſave his life may lye, and entreat <hi>Sarah</hi> ſo to do. <hi>David,</hi> thou art in danger, flye to <hi>Achiſh,</hi> play the fool and diſſemble, thou ſeeſt no way elſe left, deviſe a way of ſafety beyond Gods. <hi>Peter,</hi> thou art now in the midſt of thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters enemies, if thou turneſt not ſtones into bread, and help thy ſelf by lying, ſwearing, curſing, and denying thy Maſter, look for no other than to dye with him. Thou that art a poor man, ſeeſt hard times as if thou wert in a Wilderneſs, and here is nothing but ſtones, no way but to turn them into bread, thou canſt not live if thou doeſt not lye, or ſteal, or ſwear, or be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; poverty and danger ſhall come armed upon thee.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If wee cannot thus help our ſelves, but the evil continues, then Satan ſoliciteth us to repine and murmur within our ſelves, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 116.11. <hi>I ſaid in my diſtreſſe, that all men are lyars,</hi> and 31.22. <hi>I ſaid in my haſt, I am caſt off:</hi> and this, to bring us to diſclaime confidence and waiting upon God any longer; as <hi>Jehoram</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.33. <hi>This evil is from the Lord, and ſhall I attend any longer upon him?</hi> Thus hee daily ſhews us our croſſes, as ſo many ſtones to move us to impatiency, and gain from us our affiance in God, that hereby he may both pull and draw us from our ſtrength, and help, and glory from God. Both theſe are apparent in this dart againſt Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. In the purchaſing of ſome apparent good,
<note place="margin">Numbers have learned this trade of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to make ſtones bread.</note> hee knows the haſte of our unbeleeving hearts as well as in the former, and how eaſily wee are brought to turn ſtones into bread. In the matter of the world, what a number of men are there of this trade, which we may fitly call the Devils Alchymiſtry? Some by extortion, uſury, and oppreſſion make ſtones bread; as many Land-Lords juſt of the Devils laſt, that by racking their rents, would have their Tenants get bread out of ſtones: nay, not ſo merciful as hee; for no doubt if Chriſt had made bread of ſtones, he would have let him eat it; but ſo will not theſe, but eat up bread, and ſweat, and all. This is called, <hi>bread of violence and oppreſſion, Prov.</hi> 4.17. and becauſe being made of ſtones it is hard of digeſtion, it needeth a cup of Wine, which is at hand too: for, <hi>they eat the bread of wickedneſs,</hi> and <hi>drink the wine of violence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others, by deceit and ſubtlety turn ſtones into bread, and glory when they can go beyond their brethren, by trickes of wit, or cunning: and this ſeems to go a ſtep beyond the Devil, who would have Chriſt turn ſtones into bread, that is, ſomething into ſomething; but theſe would turn nothing into bread, but only live by their wits. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls all bread thus cunningly changed, <hi>ſtoln bread,</hi> and <hi>bread of deceit,</hi> which ſeems ſweet in the mouth: but that yee may know whence it comes, hee tells you that for all that, it returns to his former poverty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.17. <hi>The bread of deceit is ſweet to a man, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his mouth is filled with gravel.</hi> Both theſe the Apoſtle condemneth, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Let no man defraud or oppreſſe his brother in any matter; for the Lord is the avenger of all ſuch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In procuring health in ſickneſſe, or helping our ſelves to recover our loſſes, hee eaſily perſwades us to Witches, Sorcerers, and to try many unwarrantable concluſions, and enforceth them ſtrongly; perſwading us elſe that we ſhall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry and periſh by our own negligence.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This ſhews us that Satan never comes without ſtones, that is, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his temptations; at leaſt, hee hath one ſtone, which if hee offer, hee ſeemeth reaſonable. Hee hath not onely a <hi>Bathſheba</hi> for <hi>David,</hi> but every man hath his ſeveral <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> ſome dear luſt or other, which Satan will ſtill bee feeding his eyes and ſenſes upon: Nay, as <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.5. in the parties poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, hee armed them with ſtones againſt themſelves, and made them beat themſelves with ſtones; ſo out of our own ſcrip hee fetcheth ſtones againſt us, hee knoweth the inclination of our wills, the ſtream of our affections, the conſtitution of our humours, the predominant deſires of our hearts, and accordingly aſſaulteth us. Nay, not onely in evil things, but in the beſt of all hee wants not one ſtone or other againſt us: Even the tree of life it ſelf (a Sacrament of Gods Covenant of life) will ſerve his turn; and hee wiſheth not <hi>Eve</hi> to eat all the apples on it, but ſeems very reaſonable whiles hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers but one. In comming to the Word, and Sacraments, and Prayer, hee is content if a man bring but one ſtone in his heart, one ſin, either hardneſs of heart, that the ſeed may fall in ſtony ground; or unbeleef (for how know you that this is the word of God?) or covetouſneſs, which is as thornes to choak all; or malice and envy (for then God will put none of his pretious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor into ſuch a fuſty veſſel:) or wandring thoughts, or diſlike of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or any other luſt (though but one) hee cares for no more.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſhould therefore never go without our fence in our own houſes, or in Gods houſes, that wee may eſcape the danger of this battry. Yea, let us watch Satan in baſe and deſpiſed things, as an apple, or a ſtone, in idle words, or unfruitful ſpeeches, in the matter of a pin, or any ſmall trifling matter: for even in theſe things he can get much advantage, and ſow diſcord between the neareſt of all, even the husband and wife.</p>

This teacheth us, <hi>That the ſcope of all Satans proffers, is to make men earthly-minded:</hi> hee cares not how much men be addicted to ſeek bread, yea, he would have them ſo eager of bread, as rather than want it, to get it out of ſtones; for 1 Hee would fill the heart with theſe baſe deſires, that there might bee no room for better. 2 Hee knows, that if hee can make a man a ſervant to the world, hee cannot ſerve God: hee cannot ſerve two Maſters commanding ſuch contrary things. 3 Hee knows this runs with nature, and in the channel of our corruption ſince the fall, to which wee are eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and very hardly (if ever) recovered back again. God in his word deals clean contrary, and every where reigneth us in, where Satan ſpurs us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: that calls us out of the World, forbids us to <hi>ſeek,</hi> that is, immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the bread that periſheth; calleth us to heavenly mindedneſſe; to converſe and traffick in heaven: and ſend our affections above; to ſeek after Chriſt the bread of life; to give all diligence to make our election ſure; to ſeek the Kingdome of God. From whence, when wee find our ſelves ſtrongly ſet upon this World, with neglect of better things, to ſcrape and gather bread, and things for the body, wee muſt labour to eſpye Satans ſuggeſtion in it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our own inclinations to ſwallow down all ſuch temptations, and forthwith to caſt our eyes upon ſuch Scriptures as may bee back-biaſſes to our natural motion.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 To teach us, that when wee ſuffer indignity and wrong of evil men, as Chriſt here of the evil one, wee ſhould rather turn our ſelves to Doctrin, and convincing them by the Word, than to revenge: ſo did Chriſt.</p>

                     <p n="4">4 Chriſts humility and meekneſs was now a fitter weapon than power and glory, in two reſpects: 1 To the greater vexation of the adverſary, who thought himſelf ſo ſtrong and cunning, as no fleſh was ever yet able to reſiſt him, only he knew God had him in chains; but now he is foyled by the ſeed of the VVoman, by the wiſdome and weakneſs of Chriſt as man, and not by his Divine power as God. 2 Chriſts meekneſs lets him goe on, and paſs thorough all his temptations, to his greater and utter overthrow and ſilence: for if Chriſt by his Divine power had cut him ſhort at the firſt, hee would have ſaid, that God fearing his weakneſs would not ſuffer him to be tempted, or not to abide in temptation: Now his mouth is ſhut, Chriſt the Son of man foyls him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 To comfort us: 1 By ſhewing us that there is ſomething elſe beſides Divine power, to overcome all helliſh and Satanical power withall: for elſe

                     <p n="1">1 Not becauſe hee loves his Diſciples and Gods Children worſe than Satan, but becauſe the Devil and wicked ones muſt bee let go on to the height of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, as Satan here: and <hi>Judas,</hi> how patiently did Chriſt bear him all the while; yea, at his apprehenſion calling him friend? they go on to confuſion without check or bands almoſt in their life and death: But he will take up his children in the beginning, they muſt not bee let run too far, as good Parents reclaim their children timely.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 God declares his power in taking the wicked at the height, as <hi>Pharaoh, Rom.</hi> 9.17. <hi>For this cauſe have I ſtirred thee up, that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my Name might bee declared to all the world:</hi> if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had been taken at the firſt, the Lord had never had ſuch glory of his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>

                     <p n="4">4 The Lord hereby declares the riches of his glory upon veſſels of mercy, whom hee hath prepared to glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. for as hee hath prepared them, that is, decreed to glorify them, ſo hee daily prepares them to glorious uſes. as wee do our veſſels by rubbing and ſcouring, ſeparating corruption from them, and the ruſt of ſin by his rough handling them, judging them in the world, not to condemn them with the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If the Lord bee not ſo quick with thee in his corrections as with others, thou hadſt need bee the quicker with thy ſelf to judge thy ſelf,

If Chriſt bee thus meek and patient with Satan himſelf, and God uſe ſo great patience to veſſels of wrath, this commendeth unto us the grace of meekneſſe towards our brethren much more. 1 This is the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of our Saviour, who was a ſpecial School-maſter of meekneſſe, <hi>Learn of mee, for I am lowly and meek:</hi> Hee was herein teſtified to bee the Son of God, becauſe the Spirit deſcended on him in the likeneſs of a meek and harmleſs Dove: and thus wee muſt teſtify our ſelves the Sons and children of God, by the lighting of the ſame Spirit of meekneſs upon us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. 2 A meek ſpirit is much ſet by of God, and preſerveth peace with men, by ſoft anſwers, and readineſs to forgive and paſs by offences.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This reproves men of a fiery and furious diſpoſition, men as meek as rough <hi>Eſau;</hi> right <hi>Iſmaels,</hi> their hand is againſt every man, and every mans hand againſt them; like <hi>Lamech,</hi> who if hee bee provoked, will revenge a word with a blow, a ſcoff with a ſtab.

But is this Chriſtian meekneſs, to bee ſo boiſterous like a ſuddain wind, which thy ſelf ſcarce knows whence it is, or whither it tends? no, but a brutiſh meekneſs; for even the beaſts will ſcarce ſtir unprovoked; nay, wee ſay the Devil is good ſo long as hee is pleaſed; and thou art good no longer. But thou that art ſo impatient, and thus betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy meekneſs towards thy brother, what wouldeſt thou do, if thou hadſt the Devil in hand, as Chriſt had here?

                     <p>Alas! how far are wee degenerate from this our pattern, who if wee bee but the ſons of mean men, we will ſtand upon it much more than Chriſt did upon being the Son of God? we will pride it out, and ruffle, and brag, and bear our ſelves upon our anceſtors, if they bee ſtept but one ſtep above the loweſt: Chriſt, when hee had good occaſion, would not ſcarce profeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Son of God, being of another manner of ſpirit than that which breathed out that brag in the temptation afterward, <hi>All theſe will I give thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. Now to come to the ſecond point in the anſwer, namely, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</p>

                     <p>The conjunction diſcretive ſheweth our Saviours diſagreement from Satan, and that his Anſwer is negative to the temptation: for although Chriſt both might by that miracle of turning ſtones into bread, have ſhewed himſelf the Son of God, and now needed bread being hungry, yet hee would not yeeld to Satan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſeeing Chriſt, who as God could have turned ſtones into ſons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> could much more turn ſtones into bread, ſo eaſily by his word (for if hee had ſpoken to the ſtones, as Satan deſired, certainly they would have had ears to hear him) why would hee not do it? what hurt had it been?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why Chriſt who could turn ſtones into bread would not five reaſons</note> 
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Miracles muſt confirm faith in Beleevers unto ſalvation, <hi>John</hi> 2.11. but Chriſt knew the Devil could not beleeve, if hee had all the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the World. Beſides, hee had even now heard the Fathers voice, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Jeſus his beloved Son; and Chriſt knew, if hee would not beleeve
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40284:44"/> the Fathers voice, he would not beleeve for the Sons miracles.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Chriſt would not by this miracle give the leaſt ſuſpition, that either he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted his fathers ſeaſonable providence, or that he would depend for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation upon the means, but upon his Fathers word: hee was in his fathers work, and lead by the Spirit into the wilderneſs, and therefore knew he ſhould not want neceſſaries.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It was an unſeaſonable motion, it was now a time of humiliation, of temptation, of affliction, wherein it was fit to avoid all ſhew of oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was the ſcope of the temptation: for Satan would onely have him to ſhew what hee could do for a need, for a vaunt of his power. Now in a time of ſerious humiliation to advance himſelf by a miracle, had been as ſeaſonable as Snow in harveſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Chriſt would not give the leaſt credit to Satan, nor do any thing at his deſire, were it good and profitable which hee ſuggeſteth: for his end and iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue is ever wicked and devilliſh: yea, hee would ſhew, how he contemned the will of the Tempter; for hee is not overcome, unleſſe hee bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Chriſt Jeſus being the wiſdome of his Father, well knew, that Satan groſſy diſſembled with him: for hee ſpake as if hee wiſhed well unto him, and would have his hunger ſatisfied: but could hee indeed reſpect the releef of Chriſt? did hee deſire Chriſts preſervation and welfare? knew hee not that hee was the promiſed ſeed, that muſt break his head, and deſtroy his works? and therefore ſeeing Chriſt knew, that Satan muſt needs ſeek his deſtruction in all his attempts, hee had juſt cauſe to yeeld to none of them all, though they ſeemed never ſo beneficial.</p>
                     <p>In that Chriſt here would not make his Divinity known to Satan, neither by word nor miracle, wee may note, that</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>Chriſt will not purpoſely make himſelf known to ſuch as hee knows will make no right uſe of him.</hi> Luke 23.8. <hi>When</hi> Herod <hi>ſaw Jeſus,</hi>

                        <hi>hee was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad: for hee had heard many things of him, and hoped to have ſeen ſome miracle:</hi> But Chriſt would not work any ſign in his preſence, becauſe hee had wrought workes enough already to prove him the Son of God: neither was it fit to proſtitute the power of God, to the pleaſure of a vain man, who would have made no right uſe of it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.39. <hi>This evil and wicked Generation ſeeketh a ſign, and none ſhall bee given them ſave the ſign of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> Jonah? Why? had they not infinite ſignes, and miracles both then and afterwards? Yes, but they had none ſuch as they would have: for they would have ſome extraordinary ſign; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Maſter, ſhew us a ſign from heaven:</hi> as if they had ſaid, Either cauſe the Sun to ſtand ſtill or go back, as in <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> and <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> daies, or the Moon to ſtand, as in <hi>Ajelon,</hi> or call for an extraordinary tempeſt of thunder and rain, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, which made all the people to fear the Lord and <hi>Samuel</hi> exceedingly, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.18. or call for fire from heaven, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did. Theſe and the like they thought beſeeming men of God: as for turning water into wine, reſtoring of ſight and legs, &amp;c. thoſe they ſaw little power in.</p>
                     <p>But why would not our Saviour give them ſuch a ſign as they deſired? Surely hee had juſt reaſon, the ſame in this our doctrin; for they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it for a good end, but (as <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith expreſly) <hi>to tempt him:</hi> not to help their infirmity, but to feed their curioſity: neither to increaſe and ſtrengthen faith, but to nouriſh their infidelity. For had that been their end, had they not beſide the doctrin of the Prophets, and the fulfilling of the promiſes, the bleſſed Doctrin of the ſon of God, of whom ſome of themſelves ſaid, <hi>Never man spake like him;</hi> and for the confirmation of that, many and mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful miracles, which were ſigns from heaven, ſhewing that hee was from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?

                     <p n="4">4 Never could extraordinary means, convert ſuch as beleeved not the word, the ordinary means: and therefore Chriſt never or ſeldome gratified the Scribes and Phariſees with Miracles or extraordinary means, becauſe they reſiſted his Doctrin, Perſon, and Works: or if any wicked men ſaw any of his mighty VVorks and Miracles, they ſaw not himſelf in them; as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> what a number of Miracles ſaw he? yet he was never the better, he would not acknowledge God nor his ſervants: and in the Wilderneſs, they who ſaw Miracles every day and moment, yet not beleeving the VVord of God in them, were never the better; the arm of the Lord was not made bare unto them.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1, Ignorant perſons, that know not Chriſt, nor deſire to know him, are in a woful eſtate, being ſuch as Chriſt counts unworthy to reveal himſelf unto: and therefore he either keeps the means from them, or leaves them without grace to make an holy uſe of them.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. In worſe caſe are they that have the means, and yet no taſt of them, no reformation by them: their covetouſneſs, their pride, their drunkenneſs and uncleaneneſs will not be left; as many that come to Church to hear the VVord, and receive the Sacraments, and yet are no better than Doggs and Swine, and altogether unreformed in their lives and courſes. Some draw the VVord of God into queſtion, and would be taught by Angels, or Miracles, as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40284:45"/> Satan here: but Chriſt will not make himſelf known to them no more than to him: ſo ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives</hi> in Hell, when he denied his requeſt, They have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> if they will not beleeve them, neither would they beleeve if one ſhould riſe from the dead. Some are reſolved to live as they liſt, let the Preachers ſay what they can: whereas he that is in Chriſt, to whom he reveals himſelf, is a new Creature: for Chriſt ſpeaks to the heart, not to the ear only.</p>
                     <p>Others ſay, they are decreed to life or death, and therefore, doe what they can, they cannot change Gods mind, and hence never goe about to change themſelves: But, had Chriſt ſhewed himſelf to theſe, he would have directed them to the means of ſaving knowledge, namely to the Scriptures which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.29. and to faith, which unites to him, and to the fruits of faith, which teſtifie the truth of it, to his glory and their comfort. Others will be ſaved by ſaith alone, and by a profeſſion of the Goſpel, and ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the works which juſtifie it, and the power of godlineſs: whereas, if Chriſt in the Miniſtry had revealed himſelf to ſuch, he had quickned their faith, and not left it as a Carkaſs: for faith without works is dead. Others, poor ſimple people, will be ſaved by mercy alone, and never labour for knowledge, faith, or true feeling of their own eſtate, and care not how ſin abound, that mercy may abound much more: But, had Chriſt met with them, hee would let them ſee their miſery in the cauſes and effects, and teach them to hunger after mercy in the means, and having obtained it, to goe and ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing follow.</p>
                     <p>Others, diſclaiming the doctrin of mortification, and ſelf-denial, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſlike the VVord as too ſtraight a Doctrin, ſtripping them of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and profits: and hence ſome hold on in their luſts, ſome return with the Swine to their wallowing in the mire, they cannot dye to ſin, they cannot live without laughter, mirth, and ſports: Whereas, had Chriſt revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto them, he would have taught them, that his yoke is an eaſier yoke than the yoke of ſin,
<note place="margin">Three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch as to whom Chriſt will make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known.</note> and that there is no ſound comfort but in mortified affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and actions.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. VVhoſoever would have Chriſt reveal himſelf fully unto him, muſt labour to be thus qualified: 1 He muſt be humble: for he teacheth the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his ways, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9. but the proud hee ſends empty away; as rain makes vallies fruitful, but falls off the mountains, which are therefore barren. 2 He muſt long and deſire to meet Chriſt in his Ordinances: for Chriſt is the ſcope of the VVord and Sacraments: therefore deſire to know nothing but Chriſt Crucified; goe to the tents of Shepheards where he hath told thee thou ſhalt meet him. And this deſire, if it bee ſincere, will vent it ſelf in earneſt prayer, to be taught of God, <hi>Teach me thy ſtatutes, O open mine eyes,</hi> that I may ſee the wonderful things of thy Law. And it hath a promiſe to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. I will love him, and ſhew my own ſelf to him. 3 Hee muſt have a conſcionable indeavour and induſtry to obey that part of Gods will, which he revealeth unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.17. If any man will doe his will, he ſhall know whether the doctrin be from God or no.</p>

And further, whoſoever turn the people naked unto all Satans temptations, and diſarm them ſo as they cannot but bee overcome, are guilty of all the wickedneſs of the people, to which Satan draws them; and alſo of their deſtruction, unto which they be drawn: But Popiſh Teachers by deſtituting the people of the Scriptures, turn them naked into temptation, and diſarm them; and therefore are guilty of their ſin and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Learn hence how to conceive of means aright,
<note place="margin">Means not to be ſet above their own place</note> namely as things not to be truſted to, becauſe by one blaſt of God, they may become unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and unſucceſſeful, eſpecially when men are loath to raiſe their thoughts beyond them. <hi>Aſa</hi> his Phyſick ſhall not help him, becauſe hee truſts in the Phyſicians. <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall dye of that fleſh, wherein they thought their life was. And it is juſt with God, that when the means ſtep up into his place, and men aſcribe that vertue unto them, which only Gods bleſſing addeth unto them, he deprives men either of the means, or of the right and comfortable uſe of them. And were not the means too too much magnified, and ſet above their own place, men would not ſo ſpend their days in carking cares for them, with ſuch inſtance and neglect of all things elſe, as if they were ever to live by bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not ſo wiſe as the Fool and Churle in the Parable, who when he had goods enough for many years, would have his ſoul take his reſt; but theſe men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bread and means enough for many ages, are as reſtleſs and inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable, as ever before; their life ſtands in ſeeking and holding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Let us learn to truſt God without the means; which the worldling cannot doe. In plenty, in health, when the barns be full, and the cheſts ready to break with treaſures, the moſt earthly churl can bee content, and praiſe God for all: but in poverty and ſickneſs his heart lets him down, as though God is not as able and willing to help in one eſtate as in another. But now faith were it preſent, would moſt ſhew it ſelf: it is a dead faith, that withdraws it ſelf from the living God, and ſets it ſelf on dead things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Learn we to moderate our care for the things of this preſent life, as ſuch who value them according to their right eſtimate, without which a ſuperiour vertue can do us no good: for what is food, apparrel, and the like, but baſe things without Gods bleſſing, which men of thouſands enjoy abundantly, and yet by a ſecret curſe either upon the wicked getting or holding them, want the comfort that many poor men have, whoſe portion is but a mite to the others ſuperfluity? And what is the reaſon, that men bury themſelves alive in the graves of their luſtings and earthlineſs, but that they falſly conceive of the means, and place them above their worth or work? What ſaith the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? is it not my living? and muſt I not look to that? I tell thee no, it is not thy living, unleſs thou liveſt by bread alone, or haſt that <hi>animam tritici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> that wheaten-ſoul of the rich man in the Goſpel, who thought hee muſt now live many years, becauſe he had wheat enough.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But you ſpeak as though we were to expect Miracles for our mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or to caſt off our Callings, to neglect the means, and live by the Word of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Miracles are ceaſed, and yet if God bring us into an eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all means fail us, God remains as powerful and able, as merciful and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to help as ever he was, and rather than his children ſhall miſcarry, he will ſave them by miracle. 2 Our callings and means are not to bee neglected, becauſe, 1 Chriſt denies not but that man lives by means, but not <hi>only</hi> by them. 2 They are a part of that <hi>(every word of God)</hi> whereby man lives; and if ordinary means be offered, we may not truſt to extraordinary, without ſome ſpecial promiſe or revelation. 3 It is a tempting of God, to pull po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty on our ſelves, or caſt our ſelves into danger, and is a breach of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, who injoyns every man to get his living in the ſweat of his blows. But one thing is a <hi>Chriſtian care,</hi> another a <hi>carking care</hi> for the things of this world: one thing is the care of the world in <hi>Mary,</hi> who eſpecially minds the <hi>one thing neceſſary,</hi> another in <hi>Martha,</hi> who diſtracts her ſelf with many buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40284:52"/> neglecting the good part which ſhould never bee taken from her: one thing to <hi>poſſeſs</hi> the world, another to bee <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> by it: one thing to <hi>uſe</hi> means, another to <hi>truſt</hi> in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">More care muſt be had of Gods bleſſing, than of means.</note> 
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. If man live not by means alone, bee more careful for Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than for the means; bee more thankful for that, than for theſe: elſe hee that made bread, and gave it thee, can break the ſtaff of it; elſe he can make thee great and rich, but lay a ſenſible curſe on thy perſon and eſtate, either in thine own time, or in thy heirs. And as for thankſgiving, Chriſt never uſed any means but by prayer and thankſgiving, and taught us to pray for daily bread,

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> This affirmative part of the teſtimony, alledged by Chriſt, teacheth us, That, <hi>It is only the word of God, and every word of God that preſerveth the life of man.</hi> But firſt wee muſt diſtinguiſh of <hi>mans life,</hi> which is either ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural or natural; and alſo of <hi>the word,</hi> which is put forth either for the life natural or ſupernatural. The former is a word of Gods <hi>power</hi> and providence, creating and governing all things according to their natural courſes, called in the Text, <hi>a word that goeth out of the mouth of God:</hi> for no word of the creature, can produce the being or well-being of any other. The latter is the word of <hi>Truth,</hi> whereby hee doth quicken the ſoul, and repair it to his own likeneſſe: and this word proceedeth not onely out of the mouth of God, but of his Prophets, Apoſtles, and Paſtors: and this word begetteth and preſerveth a ſupernatural life in man, as the other doth a natural, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19.</p>
                     <p>Now our Saviour meaneth here the natural life of the body, and the word of Gods power and providence, generally ſuſtaining the being and life of all creatures:
<note place="margin">How the ſoul liveth by the word of God.</note> and not that a man can live by the written word without meat and drink. It is true, that the ſoul of man liveth by Gods Word of Truth: for, 1 Hee is begotten a Chriſtian by it, and born of this immortal ſeed, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. 2 Hee is nouriſhed by it, as by ſincere Milk, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. 3 As bread increaſeth the body in all dimenſions, ſo the Word ſtrengtheneth the ſoul in faith, patience, comfort, hope, love; as children grow by Milk. 4 Bread ſtrengthens the heart, and all the ſtrength of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is in the word; it preſerves the natural heat, and the word makes his heart burn within him, and keeps it in a readineſs to every good word and work.</p>
                     <p>But yet this is not the proper meaning of this place, neither can it agree with the meaning of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who plainly ſpeaks of the bodily hunger of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the feeding of them with <hi>Mannah, that they may know that man liveth not by bread onely:</hi> nor yet with the mind of our Saviour Chriſt; nor with his preſent condition; nor with the drift of Satans temptation; nor with the ſound repelling of his dart, which was, that Chriſt for the appeaſing of his bodily hunger, after his forty daies faſt, would turn ſtones into bread.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How man lives by every word of God.</note> And now, wee knowing what is meant by the Word of God, even the powerful word of Gods providence, in creating and governing all things; wee are further to conſider, that our Saviour addeth an univerſal particle, <hi>every word:</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe this word is twofold, ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. <hi>Ordinary,</hi> when God changeth not his ordinary courſe, but by means proportioned unto the ends (which are a part of his ordinary word) preſerveth and maintaineth the life hee hath given; as daily bread,

                     <p n="2">2 When hee makes a little means go beyond themſelves, as Chriſt made ſeven loaves and two fiſhes, to ſerve ſeven thouſand perſons, and much left: thus hee made a few clothes ſerve <hi>Iſrael</hi> forty years, ſo as their ſhooes did not wear out: Thus the Word of God made a little meal and oyle ſerve the Prophet and a widow a long time; 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the meal in the barrel ſhall not bee waſted, nor the oyle in the cruſe diminiſhed, till the time that the Lord ſend rain:</hi> and ſo it was, though they are nothing elſe all the while. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.42. <hi>Eliſha</hi> had twenty loaves ſent him, and ſome ears of Corn: hee commanded his ſervant to ſet them before the people: Oh (ſaith he) what are theſe to an hundred men? but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaid, The Lord hath ſaid, <hi>they ſhall eat,</hi> and <hi>yet there ſhall remain:</hi> and it came to paſs according to the word of the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 When the means are not ſo ſmall in quantity, as baſe in quality, and yet have by this word an extraordinary bleſſing; as the coarſe fare of <hi>Daniel.</hi>

                     <p n="2">II. Without <hi>means</hi> Gods word cauſeth man to live; as <hi>Moſes, Elias,</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> going out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and wandring in the Wilderneſs ſo many years, by the appointment of Gods word, he did ſupply all their wants by his Word, and it became all things unto them, which their hearts could deſire: 1 He paved them a way in the Sea, and ſuddainly made the waters a wall unto them. 2 He gave them bread from Heaven, even Angels food, and that (in our text) was by his word. 3 He gave them water out of a rock, and that by his word; he bade <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeak to the rock. 4 Having no means for clothes, his word kept their garments for forty years from waxing old. But what need we goe out of our text; in which the example of our Head and Lord may beſt confirm us? for, wanting bread in the Wilderneſs, hee would not turn ſtones into bread, but waited on the word of his Father, till the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels came and miniſtred unto him: even ſo the adopted Sons of God treading in the ſteps of our Lord, ſhall by vertue of the ſame word, always find relief one way or other.</p>
                     <p>Who would have thought, that ever <hi>Job</hi> ſhould have ſwum out of that miſery, having loſt all his Cattel, ſubſtance, and Children? but becauſe, when the Lord was a killing him in his own ſence, hee truſted in him, the Lord raiſed him and doubled the wealth and proſperity he had before. Who would have thought that ever <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould have eſcaped the Lions denne and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40284:54"/> teeth, being caſt in amongſt them? or that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have eſcaped <hi>Herods</hi> ſword being bound in Chains, and watched of Souldiers, to be brought out to death next day? But truſting in the Lord, this <hi>word</hi> ſhut the mouthes of the Lions; and opened the Priſons iron doors, and brake in ſunder the chains, and ſo both of them were wonderfully delivered.</p>
                     <p>Surely this Doctrin well digeſted, is full of comfort and quietneſs, and would ſet the heart at reſt, and make all outward troubles eaſie. If a man could once get his heart to truſt in the word, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.42. it would ſuſtain the ſoul in many troubles, and bring in ſo ſweet a contentment as the world is a ſtranger unto. On the contrary, whence is it that mens hearts fail them, and they ſink in their troubles, but becauſe they truſt to the means, and not to the <hi>Word</hi> of God, at leaſt not to <hi>every word</hi> of God? If God croſſe them one way, they think hee hath no other way to doe them good.</p>
                     <p>Vſe 3. <hi>If man live by every word of God,</hi> then take heed of making that a means of living, which God hath never warranted; but ſee that what thou liveſt by, proceed out of the mouth of God.

                     <p>Obj. <hi>But we ſee, ſuch as uſe no good means, but maintain themſelves in good eſtate by robbing, ſtealing, oppreſſing, uſury, gaming, falſe wares or weights; it ſeems that even theſe creatures have a</hi> word <hi>of God to ſanctifie them, and put ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in them to ſuch perſons; or elſe they could not live by them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> We muſt diſtinguiſh between the things themſelves that are gotten, and the unjuſt manner of getting them. The creatures themſelves are by a general word of God ſanctified, and ſet apart by God to feed and maintain good and bad, as well the wicked as honeſt getters of them, even as the Sun and Rain ſhines and falls upon the juſt and unjuſt: And the unrighteouſneſs of particular perſons cannot alter Gods general decree. But if wee conſider the ſpecial manner of getting ſuch goods, that is not ſanctified, but condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the word of God: 1 Becauſe the perſon is not in Chriſt, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores our right unto us, and then he is but an uſurper and a bankrupt, who builds his houſes, goes fine in apparel, decks up himſelf and his, and ſpends moſt liberally, but it is all with other mens money: He that knows not this, thinks him a rich man; but he that doth, knoweth that he is not either thrifty or wealthy: the Creditor comes, and caſts him into priſon, and makes his bones and body pay the debt. 2 As his perſon, ſo his courſe is accurſed: for the only way to get a bleſſing from God on the means, is to uſe his own means: who hath commanded firſt to ſeek the Kingdom of God, and then other things; and hath accurſed all that wealth and maintenance of the body, for which a man doth hazard or loſe his ſoul. 3 When a man doth live by bread, againſt the word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, it is rather a death than a life; his bread becomes poyſon, and as Ratſ-bane in his bowels, becauſe he hath it without a promiſe, and without bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>I ſee no ſuch thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Many poyſons are long a working, but the end of ſuch is death, and the more ſlowly they work, the more ſlily and certainly they kill: And if the Lord doe not invert the order he hath ſet in nature, by curſing the particular creatures be ſure he hath in his juſtice reſerved a curſe for the unjuſt perſon, and he ſhall not avoyd it.</p>
                     <p>This doctrin ſpecially applied laies hold upon ſundry ſorts of men, who live contrary to <hi>the word.</hi> They are theſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>Such as live out of lawful callings,</hi> which are one part of the word of God, that we ſhould get our living in the ſweat of our browes: and ſo long as we are in our way, we have his word we ſhall bee provided for. And the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40284:54"/> word proceeding out of the mouth of God, is, <hi>that he that will not labour, muſt not eat,</hi> becauſe he eats not his own: and ſuch as will not live after this word, by Gods word they ought not to live, becauſe they are idle and unprofitable burdens of the earth; who 1 abuſe Gods providence, who ties the ends and means together: 2 infringe that good order, which God hath eſtabliſhed for the avoiding of confuſion in Church or Common-wealth, namely that every man ſhould ſerve God in the ſervice of man, in ſome warrantable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable civil calling: 3 As hee is no better than an Infidel, that depends only on means, ſeeing man lives by every word of God; ſo he that in a lawful courſe of life provides not for his family, is worſe than an infidel. Of this ſort are our knots of companions, of drinking, and gaming company, and wandring rouges and beggers: I knit them together, becauſe they are all of a ſtrain, and either are Beggers, or ſhall be. Theſe commonly come not to Church, to hear their duties, and therefore they muſt bee taught by correction and diſcipline of thoſe that are the executioners of juſtice.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Such as think they live well enough,</hi> and yet it is by deceiving others by ſtealing, oppreſſion, extortion, lying, ſwearing, and falſhood in buying, and ſelling: and why (ſay they) may not a man help and ſhift for himſelf? But conſider, 1 What a poor help it is, when a man will uſe unlawful means, and to ſhift out of one evil by another: Hee doth, as the Prophet ſpeaks, avoid a Lyon, and a Bear meets him. <hi>Pilate</hi> would keep his place by unlawful means, the delivering of Chriſt to bee crucified: but, beſides that hee brought innocent blood upon himſelf, hee loſt his place, and flew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 2 Conſider, That if Gods Word of bleſſing go not with the means, his word of curſe doth: and ſo the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> ſaith, that the curſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth into the houſe of the ſwearer, and of the theef, chap. 5. v. 4. and this curſe ſhall remain in the midſt of his houſe, and conſume the very timber and ſtones. This curſe often ſcatters ill-gotten goods as faſt as they were ever haſtily gathered, if not in his own daies, yet in ſome unthrifty heir after him. 3 Conſider, how God croſſeth the vain conceit of unjuſt perſons; they think all that is any way gotten, to bee gain and profit; but the <hi>word is, Prov.</hi> 10.2. that treaſures of wickedneſſe profit nothing, they cannot help a man from the hand of God; nay, when the evil day comes, they are gone, and leave a man alone to grapple with death and judgement, and turn a man naked to the ſentence of condemnation for his wicked getting and holding of them.</p>

                     <p>The firſt Rule concerning our Calling is this: The carriage of our calling according to Gods Word, is a ſpecial part of that word of God by which man muſt live.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How may I carry my calling according to Gods word?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By theſe means: 1 Wee muſt make choice of ſuch callings for our ſelves and ours, as bee profitable for the Church or Common-wealth: there bee many vain and new-fangled inventions, which rather maintain ſin, than bring any good to the Church or Common-wealth. But God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beſtoweth variety of gifts, to furniſh men to the variety of callings, all for the common, and every ones private good. 2 Seeing not the having of a Calling, but the right uſe of it glorifieth God, wee muſt uſe our callings with the practice of ſundry vertues.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>In faith and obedience to God:</hi> Faith makes our perſons, obedience makes our actions approved of God; yea, every duty of our calling ought to bee an obedience of faith, looking at the commandement and promiſe; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement keeps us within the compaſs of our callings, the promiſe ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us of good ſucceſs. A good action not warranted by a calling is ſin.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:40284:56"/>2 <hi>In diligence,</hi> not wilfully neglecting, but ſerving and redeeming the means of Gods providence: Every man muſt abide in his calling, and keep him in his way, for ſo long hee is ſure to bee provided for: thus bee avoides idleneſs and deſtruction, and maintains the order and rank wherein God hath ſet him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>In cheerfulneſs,</hi> not carking or exceſſively careful, but doing the labour and leaving all the ſucceſs to God. Some are heart-leſſe in their calling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it brings in ſo little profit and return; and labour as the Oxe, who muſt go out his journey, but without cheerfulneſſe or heart, which God looks for in all our duties. Such ſhould conſider, 1 That Callings were not onely ordained to get money, but help us cheerfully through our way, and contain us in a courſe wherein to pleaſe God. 2 That the goodneſſe and worth of a calling is not to bee meaſured by that profit it brings in to us, but by the publike benefit, and as it is rightly uſed: God may bee ſerved as well in the baſeſt, as in the beſt.

                     <p>The ſecond rule concerneth our wealth and maintenance, namely, not to content our ſelves, that wee can live by ſuch or ſuch means, unleſs wee can ſay, Gods Word doth warrant mee, that this is my meat, my drink, my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, my money, my houſe, my land, &amp;c.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 When a man having nothing of his own, nor right to any thing, becomes a beleever, ingrafted into Chriſt, and ſo owner of that bee hath. A man may have warrant and title from man, that his houſe and land is his, and hee is a robber that ſhall defeat him of it. But all men and Angels cannot give mee a poſſeſſion, and true title before the living God, but only his Son, who is Lord and heir of all. Firſt, know thy ſelf a member of Chriſt, and then his right is thine. 2 When the manner of getting them is lawful, and that is,</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> When it is moderate and retired, when a man ſo provideth for earth; as hee eſpecially ſtoreth up for heaven: firſt, ſeeking Gods Kingdome, and the one thing neceſſary, without covetouſneſſe, and the love of this life; nay, accounting all things dung in compariſon of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the manner of uſing them is warrantable, that a man ſhews himſelf a good ſteward in the holy diſpenſing of them, uſing them as furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of piety, as pledges of love towards men, and as teſtimonies of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in himſelf, and every way making them ſervants to his chriſtian cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy riches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 When his affection is indifferent, both in the having and holding of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40284:56"/> them, that a man may ſay. Theſe be mine, I am not theirs; I have them, they have not me; I am their Maſter to command them, they command not me. And why ſhould we not draw our affections from them, ſeeing, 1 The wicked are as rich, yea richer in theſe things than the beſt? at the beſt they make not their Maſters better: 2 They bee no inheritance, they bee but moveables, changing their Maſter as the giver will; and while we have them, they are but lent us: 3 We are but Stewards, we ſit not in our own, but have a large account to make: yea we are very Pilgrims and Travellers, and ſhall goe lightlier and leſs loaden: 4 Wee muſt not meaſure or tye God unto them, nor eſteem of his love by them.</p>
                     <p>Thus a man may uſe the mercies of God with comfort, for his neceſſity and for his delight in the days of his pilgrimage: thus may he diſpoſe them to his heirs as the right owners, with hope of Gods bleſſing to ſtand with them: nothing of which can be expected in goods ill gotten, or ſpent, to which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Gods curſe is intayled.</p>
                     <p>The third rule concerneth our health and ſuſtenance, namely, that it is far better to want means, than to procure them by any other means, than that which proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Yet numbers will maintain their lives health, and eſtate not by Gods word, but directly againſt it: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they that ſeek to Witches and Sorcerers for health, or goods loſt, or ſtollen, or upon any other occaſion whatſoever. Whereas the word procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the mouth of God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.10. is this, Let there bee none ſound among you that uſeth Witchcraft, or is a regarder of times, or a Sorcerer, Charmer, Sooth-ſayers, or that counſelleth with ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But Gods Word and Ordinance is with them to doe us good; and much good they doe, which none elſe can doe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> God hath a two-fold word: 1 Of Bleſſing. 2 Of Judgement: the former proceedeth out of the mouth of God, who is goodneſs it ſelf; the latter ſometimes hee permitteth to proceed out of the mouth of the Devil, giving him power to work lying wonders, that the ſeekers of him might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him to their final deſtruction. Thus the Devil, who can doe nothing againſt Gods word, doth what he doth by Gods word ſpoken in Judgement and Juſtice. Whence I conclude,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It were better for a man to want cure than have the Devil his Phyſician: better for a man to want health of his body, than procure it with the death of his ſoul: Better had it been for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to have wanted Quails, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them, by murmuring, to be choaked with them: Better for a man to want the world, than winne it with the loſs of his ſoul: Better had it been for <hi>Ahab</hi> to have wanted <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, than to loſe the whole Kingdom for it: Better for <hi>Judas</hi> to have wanted the thirty pence, than to hang himſelf for them: for <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> to have wanted the third part of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, than to dye for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 2. Better it were to want the means of health and maintenance, than not to uſe them according to the word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God, as food, apparel, phyſick, health, and life it ſelf. Had it not been better that <hi>Aſa</hi> had wanted Phyſick, than be ſtruck with death becauſe he truſted in Phyſitians? Better had it been for <hi>Gehazi</hi> to have gone in raggs, than to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel himſelf by lying and deceit, which apparelled himſelf and all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with Leproſie. Whether was the ſtate of <hi>Lazarus</hi> (that dyed for want of means) or of <hi>Dives</hi> better, that ſared deliciouſly every day? Leſs have men to anſwer for, who have no meat to ſtrengthen nature, than thoſe that have abundance, which they pervert to ſtrengthen themſelves in ſin, ſacrificing their ſtrength to the ſervice of the Devil, and to their luſts. Wee our ſelves know numbers in all corners, who were better continually to be bed-ridd, and ſick, or maimed, than to abuſe their health and lives in ſuch ryotous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40284:57"/> courſes, to the deſtruction of themſelves and others. Nay, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid of <hi>Judas,</hi> it had been good for him hee had never been born; ſo may we ſay of numbers of graceleſs perſons, better they had never ſeen the Sun, or enjoyed life, than ſo to have conſumed their lives in the ſervice of ſin, and Satans temptations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 5. Laſtly, If we live by every word of God, then let us be thankful to God for our lives, and for his word of bleſſing upon the means: and ſeeing our lives hang upon his word, to prolong them, or cut off the thread of them, we muſt labour to live to him and his glory. It becometh the juſt to be thankful. A great unthankfulneſs were it to rebel againſt him, by whom we hold our lives, and all the comfort of them: See we not how thoſe that hold Land in Copy, are willingly bound to ſute and ſervice to the Lord, who is often but a mean man? The <hi>Sidonians</hi> would not warre againſt <hi>Herod,</hi> becauſe they were nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by his Land: and ſhall we be in warre againſt our Lord, by whoſe hand and word we live, move, and have our being? And even this thankſgiving is his gift alſo: for as the matter which, ſo the grace by which wee are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is all from him; ſo as we muſt depend on him both for bleſſings, and for grace to be thankful.</p>

                     <p>WE come now to ſet down and expound, by the aſſiſtance of God, the ſecond on-ſet of the Devil upon the Son of God, by a violent and helliſh temptation, nothing inferiour to the former, in the furious, malicious, and cunning contriving of it.</p>
                     <p>In the entrance whereof, we muſt remove one rubb by the way, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the order of this temptation, wherein the Evangeliſts ſeem not to agree among themſelves: for whereas St. <hi>Matthew</hi> makes this the ſecond, St. <hi>Luke</hi> makes it the laſt, and puts the laſt in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> into the ſecond place. And herein ſome learned men have ſtumbled, and have deviſed ſimple ſhifts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the two Evangeliſts. Some think, that they write not the ſame Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor of the ſame temptations, but of temptations urged at ſundry times. Theſe are confuted by the very matter, phraſes, and words, which are in both the ſame, and need no other conviction.</p>
                     <p>Others think (and they of the learned Papiſts) that in ſome ancient Books, St. <hi>Luke</hi> obſerves the ſame order in the temptations with St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and that the difference crept in by the heedleſneſs of ſome Writer: which is a needleſs deviſe of them, who ſtrive to prove the Canonical Scripture to bee corrupted in their Fountains, that ſo their corrupt Latine Tranſlation may prevail; but both impeaching the watchfulneſs and care of God over the Scriptures, as alſo the diligence and faithfulneſs of the Church, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſuffer her ſelf wholly to be abuſed, by the careleſneſs or unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome one Scribe.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, that it doth no whit prejudice the truth of the Evangelical ſtory, that the Evangeliſts doe not ſtand ſo much upon order, where it is not ſo neceſſary, as upon the matter, and the things themſelves done, which they faithfully report, and in which they joyntly accord and agree: as oftentimes they ſtand not upon words, nor ſometimes upon ſentences, but one delivers the ſame fact in one ſtyle of ſpeech, another in another form; but ſo, as one is ſo far from croſſing another, as he giveth thereby more light and certainty unto the other.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But whether of theſe obſerved the right order, as the temptations were paſſed?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:40284:57"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I am out of doubt, that <hi>Matthew</hi> ſets down the right order as they were done: 1 Becauſe he paſſeth his ſtory by ſuch particles as imply an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly conſequent: as, <hi>Then</hi> the Devil took him, <hi>then</hi> he took him again, <hi>then</hi> the Devil left him, &amp;c. whereas <hi>Luke</hi> uſed the particle <hi>and,</hi> in his paſſages,
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> which noteth no certain order, as the former doth: his care was to relate the whole matter, but was not ſo accurate for order. 2 The coherence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of this ſecond temptation with the former ſhews, that <hi>Matthew</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the right method: for Chriſt having by a teſtimony of Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed himſelf in the confidence and truſt in his Father, Satan immediately ſeeks to make his advantage of Chriſts words, and ſeeing hee will needs truſt his Father, he would have him truſt him too much; If hee need no bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hungry, he needs no ſtairs to goe down from the pinacle of the Temple; the laſt temptation doth not ſo fitly cohere with the former, as this ſecond doth. 3 After Chriſt had bidden Satan avoyd, <hi>Matthew</hi> adds, <hi>Then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil left him,</hi> as being obedient to his word; plainly ſhewing, that that was the laſt temptation. <hi>Luke</hi> hath it not in ſuch dependance, but thus, <hi>And when the Devil had ended all the tentation, he departed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Combate note two generals, 1 The preparation to it. 2 The temptation it ſelf. The preparation containeth ſuch neceſſary circumſtances, as by which the temptation might more eaſily prevail; as, 1 the time, <hi>Then.</hi> 2 The place, firſt general, <hi>the holy City;</hi> ſecondly ſpecial, <hi>a pinacle of the Temple.</hi> 3 The manner how Chriſt was conveyed thither, <hi>The Devil took him up, and ſet him on the pinacle.</hi> The temptation conſiſts, 1 Of the aſſault. 2 Of the repulſe.</p>
                     <p>The aſſault hath three things: 1 The ground of it, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> 2 The ſcope or aim, namely, the ſin or ſins to which hee was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down.</hi> 3 The argument or perſwaſion to enforce it, <hi>For it as written, He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, &amp;c.</hi> The repulſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is by another teſtimony of Scripture, not contrary to that which Satan alleadged, but expounding it, that he might in the right ſenſe of it, ſence and ſecure himſelf from the temptation, as after we ſhall ſee.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, of the preparation: <hi>Then]</hi> This particle ſhews not only the time of this temptation, but alſo the order as I noted: Satan having no ſucceſs in the former, renews his aſſault, and would aſſay another way. Hee had been kindly and gently uſed of Chriſt, who had anſwered him courteouſly; nay, he had convinced him by Scripture, that hee had nothing to ſay againſt it, and yet he goes on in his malice, as though he had had both great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and advantage. Whence,</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>Note the property of wicked men ruled by Satan, who by no means can be brought to lay off their malice towards Gods children.</hi> Deal gently with them, they are like Nettles, the ſoftlier toucht, the ſharper they ſting: Deal plainly with them, and convince their conſciences by the word, that they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for themſelves, yet being convinced they give not over, no more than Satan here, but proceed in miſchief. And what are the reaſons?</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Becauſe the godly in their courſes doe oppoſe themſelves to the darkneſs of this world: now there is no fellowſhip between light and darkneſs, no way to reconcile them, as we may ſee in the example of the wicked <hi>Sodomites</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lot:</hi> firſt he reſiſted their wickedneſs, when they came about his houſe to abuſe the two men; he gives them fair words, <hi>I pray you my brethren;</hi> hee convinceth their conſciences, <hi>Doe not ſo wickedly;</hi> and out of his weakneſs he offers them his two Daughters: but, being a righteous perſon, whoſe ſoul was daily vexed with their uncleaneneſs, neither his piety, nor humanity, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, no nor his weakneſs and ſin could pleaſe them, but, Away with him hence, he is a ſtranger, ſhall he judge and rule? now we will deal worſe with him than with them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.9.</p>

                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:40284:58"/>2 Chriſt gives another Reaſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>You are of your Father the Devil, for his works yee do.</hi> In that Chapter Chriſt plainly teacheth the Jews, that hee is the light, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. they tell him hee bears record of himſelf, and therefore his record is falſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. hee tells them hee ſhall go from them, and carry the light with him, and they ſhall ſeek him, and not find him: what (ſay they) will hee kill himſelf? <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. hee tells them, that hee that keepeth his word, ſhall never ſee death: then ſaid they, Now wee know thou haſt a Devil, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. Hee tells them, before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, I am: and they take up ſtones to ſtone him. Here were the Children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who was a man-ſlayer from the beginning: And of theſe Chriſt ſaid, Yee go about to kill mee, a man that hath told you the truth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. and, Yee do that which you have ſeen with your Father, and not only ſeen, but felt him moving and ſtiring in their hearts: ſo he worketh mightily in the ſons of diſobedience, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>The more light and grace the Lord manifeſteth in any of his children, the more muſt the darkneſſe of wicked ones fight againſt it.</hi> It is not their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, their holineſſe, their wiſdome, their peaceable courſe of life, that can fence them; nay, theſe bring all the malice of the wicked on them, and lay them open to their rage. <hi>Stephen,</hi> a man full of faith and power, whoſe enemies were not able to reſiſt the Wiſdome and Spirit by which hee ſpake, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.8. yet drew they him to the Councill, and ſubordened falſe witneſſe againſt him: where what ſhould hee do? They might, and did ſee his face thine as the face of an Angel, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. In his Apology hee begins as a perſon at the bar, with a loving and moving ſpeech, Men, Brethren, and Fathers, hearken: afterward in the courſe of his ſpeech, as a faithful ſervant of God, and true teacher, hee freely reproves them, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 51, 52. calls them reſiſters of the Holy Ghoſt, betrayers and murtherers of the juſt, hee could convince them out of all the Scriptures, as Chriſt did Satan here: But the more full of the Holy Ghoſt hee was, the more were they filled with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh fury, like ſo many Devils, or furies, their hearts braſt for anger, they gnaſhed with their teeth, more like fell and ſavage beaſts, than men; they ſhouted with a loud voice, ſtopped their ears, upon upon him, caſt him out of the City, and ſtoned him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The inceſtant malice of the wicked againſt the children of God, is a running ſtream from this of <hi>the wicked one,</hi> againſt the natural Son of God: the Devil would ſtill, if hee could, tempt and moleſt Chriſt himſelf in his own perſon, but that hee cannot, hee will therefore bee ſure to moleſt him in his ſervants: hee would obſcure the glory of Chriſt in himſelf, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee cannot do that, he will do what hee can by himſelf, and all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to extinguiſh that glory of Chriſt in thoſe beams, wherewith his ſervants are graced and honoured: And this makes this war ſo irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Therefore let us not marvel, when wee ſee good things, and good men reſiſted, nor condemn that preſently which wee may ſee oppoſed: but 1 Turn our eyes upon that natural enmity which is between the ſeed of the woman, and of the Serpent. 2 Upon mens ſtubbornneſs againſt the truth, and malice, by which the ſinner given up by God to Satan is obfirmed and hardened. 3 Upon the powerful work of Satan in men of great gifts, that being convinced in conſcience, even againſt that light, can reſiſt godly and innocent men. 4 Upon the love of mens ſins, profits, and pleaſures, which ſets on forward this hatred againſt their conſcience. What could Chriſt himſelf do to conciliate <hi>Judas</hi> his favour? Did not hee know that Chriſt was the Meſſiah? did hee not preach him? did hee not work miracles in his name? did not Chriſt make him one of his family, and prefer him to be the Steward of his houſe? did hee not warn him of his ſin, and bear him
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40284:58"/> moſt patiently? Yet his heart being upon covetouſneſſe, for a ſmall commodity hee will betray Chriſt, and that againſt his conſcience. 5 Other perſonal and private occaſions, may force men of great gifts to malign and hate (againſt their conſciences) moſt innocent perſons.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> knew that Chriſt was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that hee was moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Doctrin, and moſt holy in his life; yet they loved their own praiſe, and therefore thruſt down Chriſt; If wee let him alone, all will beleeve in him. They thought themſelves ſo much diſhonoured, as Chriſt was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. Sometime fear of great men, or ſome loſs, or check, may cauſe this obſtinate oppoſition. <hi>Pilate</hi> knew Chriſt was an innocent man, he waſhed his hands, and would have no hand againſt him; hee pronounced him inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſaying, <hi>I find no fault in him:</hi> his wife being troubled in a dream, ſent him word, <hi>he ſhould have nothing to do againſt that juſt man.</hi> Yet againſt his conſcience, and his own words, hee proceeded to condemn him. Why? how could hee bee ſo blind and wicked? ſurely it was fear of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and of ſome cheeck: for hee had heard them ſay, <hi>If thou let this man go, thou are not</hi> Caeſars <hi>friend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. It ſhould teach us to go on undaunted in our godly courſe, making no account of all the malice that the Devil or his inſtruments can create us, and never offer to ſhake hands with them; wee ſhall never have done if wee go about to pleaſe them; wee can not do it unleſs wee will bee as bad as they, if wee retain our favour of goodneſſe, it doth but provoke them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Many men may hence ſee what ſpirit rules them, who when they hear Scripture againſt their ſinnes and unwarrantable courſes, they go on ſtill as a chafed colt, that cares neither for pale nor hedge, but flings over. Theſe men would bee loath to bee compared to the Devil, but wee ſhall ſee them for worſe, and the Devil not ſo bad as many of them. When hee hears Chriſt alledge Scripture, hee ſaith nothing againſt it, but was ſilent, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies not, and much leſs rails on him as a phantaſtical or preciſe perſon. But reprove the Swearer, the Drunkard, the Gameſter, the unjuſt courſes of men in their trades, Sabbath-breaking in Maſters or Servants, and do it out of the Scripture, as Chriſt did; wee ſhall have the ſame meaſure that hee had returned from the Scribes and Phariſees, who railed out-right on him; He is too preciſe and ſevere, wee can do nothing for him; or, What hath hee to do with our Government, or Trades? or, He might finde other things to ſpeak of.</p>
                     <p>Thus if <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak againſt <hi>Diana,</hi> or whatſoever the craft-maſters live by, all the City is in an uproar againſt him. It ſeems men are loath in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to meddle with the word of God, or the directions of it, elſe wee ſhould have to deal with them. It were too much to ſit down ſilent, and go on in ſinne againſt the Word: but to reſiſt the word in termes, or to rail upon the Preachers thereof, goes one ſtep beyond the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. Take knowledge of the ſecret working of the Devil againſt the light and truth, in ſuch as ſpurn againſt it. They cannot abide that truth and innocency ſhould acquit it ſelf; but though they ſee nothing but meekneſs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and innocency, yet will ſide againſt it, as though they had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage and occaſion. What is the cauſe, that men will take part with moſt abject and baſe perſons, and bring the curſe on themſelves, in condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the innocent, and juſtifying the wicked in their horrible riots and misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, but the hatred they carry againſt goodneſſe? Why did the Jews band themſelves for <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and ſeek to acquit him? Was it becauſe there was any cauſe of love in him? knew they him not to bee a murtherer and a Rebel? Yes, It was hatred of Chriſt that made them ſtick to him: and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40284:59"/> why hated they Chriſt, but becauſe he was the light? Some there bee of that Jewiſh generation leſt, to whom, if Chriſt be weighed with <hi>Barrabas,</hi> he will ſeem too light; <hi>Barrabas</hi> ſhall carry the credit and defence from him; <hi>Not him, but</hi> Barrabas.</p>

                     <p>We come to the ſecond circumſtance in the preparation to this ſecond aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, which is the place that Satan chuſeth; ſet down, 1 In general, the <hi>holy City.</hi> 2 In ſpecial, <hi>a pinacle of the Temple.</hi> What <hi>holy City</hi> this was, <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.9. <hi>He brought him to Jeruſalem,</hi> here called <hi>the holy City.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is called the <hi>holy City,</hi> not becauſe of any holineſs in the place: for no place as a place is more holy than other. It is true, that wee read in Scripture of holy ground, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5. Mount <hi>Horeb</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood is called holy ground, and <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt put off his ſhooes. But this was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent holineſs in the place, only for the preſent the preſence of God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a ſpecial manner, makes a ſpecial holineſs to bee aſcribed unto it. Neither is it called <hi>holy</hi> in reſpect of the people and Inhabitants: for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful City was long before this become an Harlot, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.21. and Chriſt not long after this Combate, cryeth out againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> That ſhee had killed the Prophets, and ſlain ſuch as were ſent unto her, and proclaimeth a ſpeedy deſolation againſt her. But it was ſo called,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Becauſe God had made choyce of this City to put his name there, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.12. I have choſen this place for my ſelf. Hence was it called the City of God, and Gods holy Mountain, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.16. and the holy Hill of <hi>Sion;</hi> becauſe God had choſen it, and ſanctified it for himſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf kept reſidence, and made it eminent above all the places of the earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Becauſe of the holy things which were there eſtabliſhed, even all the holy worſhip of God; it was not lawful for the <hi>Jewes</hi> to ſacrifice or eat the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over any where but in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was the Temple built on mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> wherein, I. There was the <hi>Sanctum ſeculare,</hi> the utter Court of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Salomons</hi> porch, which did riſe up by fourteen ſtairs, wherein Chriſt preached often, and <hi>Peter</hi> healed the lame man, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.3. and probably, where <hi>Peter</hi> converted three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouls at one Sermon. In this porch was the great brazen Altar for whole Burnt-offerings, on which Altar the fire (which at <hi>Aarons</hi> firſt offering in the Wilderneſs fell from Heaven, <hi>Levit</hi> 9.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this Court was the great braſen Sea, wherein the Prieſts waſhed themſelves, and the Beaſts to be offered on that Altar, eſpecially their feet, becauſe they were to miniſter bare-foot before the Lord. Both of them holy repreſentations of Chriſt; the former of his Sacrifice, who gave himſelf for a whole Burnt-offering; the latter the fruit of it, he being the Laver of the Church, by whoſe bloud we are waſhed from the guilt and power of ſin.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. There was the inner Court, which was called the <hi>Sanctum,</hi> or the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, or the Court of the Prieſts, whence the <hi>Jewes</hi> were barred. There was here. 1 The Altar of Incenſe for ſweet perfume, wherein the Prieſts were evening and morning, to burn the holy Incenſe before the Lord, as a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour unto God, and no ſtrange incenſe might be offered thereon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.9. While <hi>Zachary</hi> ſtood at the right ſide of this Altar, offering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to God, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſtood and fore-told the birth of <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> This was an holy type of Chriſt, who offered himſelf on the altar of the Croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a ſacrifice of ſweet ſmell to God his Father, and through whom God ſavoureth a ſweet ſmell from all our duties. 2 In this Court was the golden
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40284:59"/> Candleſtick, with ſeven Lamps, and ſeven Lights, which were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed with moſt pure holy oyl, night and day, to lighten the whole inner Court. And this was an holy type of Chriſt, the light of the world, enlightening all his elect with ſpiritual and heavenly light. 3 In this Court was that golden Table, on which the holy Shew-bread was ever to ſtand, even twelve Loaves, which were to be made of the pureſt flower of Wheat, and were to bee renewed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sabbath, the old Loaves converted to the Prieſts uſe: a holy type of Chriſt, in whom alone the Church, and every member, ſetting themſelves continually before God, are nouriſhed and preſerved unto eternal life. 4 In this Court was that coſtly and precious Veil, of blew ſilk, and purple, and ſcarlet, and fine twined Linnen, made of broydered work with <hi>Cherubims,</hi> the uſe of which was to ſeparate the <hi>Sanctum</hi> from the <hi>Holy of Holies:</hi> this veil at the death of Chriſt was rent from the top to the bottom. A notable repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the fleſh of Chriſt, which hid his Divinity, but being rent aſunder by his paſſion on the Croſs, the way to Heaven was laid open unto us.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. There in the Temple was the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> and in it the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, called the inner houſe of God, into which only the High Prieſt went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone once a year, and that in the Feaſt of expiation, wherein all the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt faſt and afflict themſelves. A moſt notable type of Chriſt: for as it was called an Oracle, becauſe God thence gave anſwer in doubtful caſes; ſo who is the Fathers Oracle but his Son, who is <hi>the word</hi> of his Father, by whom he ſpeaks to us, by whom we ſpeak to him, and through whom the Father heareth us? In this Holy of Holies was the Ark of the Covenant, and in this holy place ſtayed the Ark almoſt four hundred and thirty years, ſignifying Chriſt the author of the Covenant between God and us. In which Ark or Cheſt were kept three things: 1 The Tables of the Covenant, written with the finger of God, ſignifying Chriſt, who is the fulfilling of the Law. 2 The Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> which had budded, a type of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, who in the world ſeemed a dead branch and dry, but after his Death and Reſurrection began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to flouriſh, and bring fruits of life to Jewes and Gentiles. 3 The Pot having Manna a holy type of Chriſt the bread of life, and that <hi>Manna</hi> that came down from heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35.</p>
                     <p>In this Holy of Holies over the Ark was the holy cover, called the <hi>Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> prefiguring the Lord Jeſus, whom the Father hath made our <hi>Propitiatory</hi> by faith in his bloud, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. Here alſo were the two glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cherubims, ſet like Angels on either ſide the Ark, looking upon the Ark, figuring the holy Angels miniſtring to Chriſt, and earneſtly deſiring to look into the myſtery of our ſalvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were the chief holy things eſtabliſhed in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but not all: for there were beſides theſe, the obſervation of all holy Rites ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, the Chair of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in it the Law read and expounded: there were the holy perſons, the High Prieſt with all his holy garments, with <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and on his fore-head, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord:</hi> there were other the holy Miniſters of the Lord, who had the Lords holy Oyl upon them, of Gods own compoſition, with ſtraight charge, that no other ſhould make or uſe it out of this uſe. Yea, here had lived the ancient Kings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>David, Salomon, Joſiah, Hezekiah,</hi> who were ſpecial types of Chriſt. In which regard <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the ſeat of God and Gods worſhip, is called the <hi>City of perfect beauty, the joy of the whole earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is called an <hi>holy City</hi> by compariſon unto other great Cities of the neighbour Countries, wherein Idols and Devils were worſhipped in ſtead of God, as <hi>Babylon;</hi> or whoſe worſhip was the deviſe of mans brain, and no inſtitution of God, as <hi>Samaria, Ceſarea,</hi> and others, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.33.</p>

                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:40284:60"/>4 It is called <hi>holy</hi> in type, two waies. 1 As it was a type of the Church militant, of which the members are holy in part, at leaſt in profeſſion. For the whole Church of God was gathered together three times every year before the Lord; at the feaſts of Paſſeover, Pentecoſt, and Tabernacles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.4. Thither the Tribes of the Lord go up, and appear before the Lord. 2 As it was a type of the Church triumphant, even that Celeſtial <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, that new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into which no unholy thing can enter, but is the eternal habitation of the holy God, the Holy Angels and Saints.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 It was called <hi>holy,</hi> or <hi>the holy City,</hi> becauſe it was the fountain of Gods holy Religion, which being firſt ſeated there by God, muſt be derived thence, and ſent out to all other Nations. <hi>Micah</hi> 4.2. The Law ſhall go out of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the word of the Lord from <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Therefore was it the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropola</hi> and mother City, the heart of the earth, placed in the midſt of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by Gods own confeſſion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.5. Nay, there muſt the pretious blood of the holy Son of God be ſhed, which muſt ſtream and run out to the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Nations, and himſelf Preached the King of the Jews, upon the Croſs as upon the theater, in Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, and that in the time of the Paſſeover, when there was a concourſe of all the people of Jews, and other Nations. There the Apoſtles muſt give their firſt witneſſe of Chriſt, and thence muſt carry it into <hi>Judea, Samaria,</hi> and all nations to the utmoſt parts of the earth, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.8. And 8.1. the Church of the New Teſtament was firſt gathered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thence by perſecution ſcattered into all Nations. In this regard it was called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>the Holy City:</hi> for all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of all other Cities was derived thence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1 Wee learn out of this title, <hi>what it is that makes places and perſons holy, even the preſence of God, of his word, and worſhip.</hi> Thus the ground was called <hi>holy, Exod.</hi> 3.5. and the place where <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſtood, when the captain of the Lords Hoſt appeared unto him, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.15.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Whatſoever was in the Law ſeparated to God and his ſervice, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led holy: the Sabbath was holy, the Prieſts Garments holy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. <hi>Thou ſhalt make holy Garments for</hi> Aaron <hi>thy brother:</hi> Holy, both becauſe they were peculiar to the holy Prieſthood, (for none elſe might put them on) and becauſe they were to bee uſed in the holy place (for when they came forth of the Tabernacle, they muſt put them off:) and thirdly, conſecrate to holy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to bee an holy type of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, a precious robe wherein all our Sacrifices are offered. The fleſh was holy, which was offered to the Lord in ſacrifice, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.13. For places, <hi>Bethel</hi> was an holy place, when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw the viſion of the Ladder there; and the Temple was holy. For people, the Jews were called an holy Nation, and Chriſtians, an holy Prieſthood, and Saints by calling, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. For perſons, ſome are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the wombe to ſome ſpecial ſervice, as <hi>Jeremy, chap.</hi> 1.5. and <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.</hi> Yea, every faithful mans heart, is as it were an Ark of God, in which are kept the Tables of the Law, yea, the Tabernacle of God, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Holy Ghoſt, where hee pleaſeth to dwell. And thus was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> an holy City, ſo long as it continued in the true worſhip of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This appears by the contrary, ſeeing his holineſſe was no further annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this place, than God tyed his preſence to it; for when as the Jews had crucified the Lord of glory, both the Temple and City, as prophane were deſtroyed, and delivered into the hand of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and are now in the hands of the <hi>Turks</hi> a neſt of unclean and Idolatrous beaſts, moſt ſavage ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt, and Chriſtian profeſſion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That place muſt needs bee holy, where the Lord dwelleth as a maſter in his houſe; teaching, ordering, and ſupplying all neceſſaries: where Chriſt the Holy Son of God walketh in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40284:60"/> being converſant among the flocks of Shepheards: where the Holy Spirit of God is preſent to pour out his treaſures of wiſdome and grace, by means of the word and Sacraments, which are his chariot, and which, not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Spirit, are but dead and ineffectual to regeneration: where the Holy Angels are preſent to aſſiſt the miniſtery, to repel hinderances, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our order; but eſpecially deſirous to look into the myſteries of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: where the Holy Saints upon earth, are met together to ſeek and ſee the face of the Lord, joyning together in all the parts of his pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip, in hearing his holy word, receiving his holy Sacraments, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring publikely their holy prayers, greatly by this means glorifying God, and inriching their own ſelves: Surely, this is <hi>Bethel,</hi> the houſe of God, and the gate of heaven.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This teacheth us not to deſpiſe our Aſſemblies, nor to think out Churches unholy for ſome corruptions. Look upon <hi>Jeruſalem, Matth.</hi> 23.37. you ſhall ſee the eleven Tribes were Apoſtates, there were in it dumb dogs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.10. there were Scribes, and Phariſees, hypocrites; nay, at this time the Doctrin of the Law was corrupted by the falſe gloſſes of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, and the Temple almoſt a den of Theeves, full of buyers and ſellers. Yet for all this, the Evangeliſt calls it the <hi>holy City,</hi> even when it had more corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, than the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath at this day. Why? 1 Becauſe there was the ſervice of the true God ſet up in the Temple, the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſacrifices offered, and the meetings of the Church of God. 2 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as yet they had not received a bill of divorcement. Have not wee the Word truely Preached, and the Sacraments for ſubſtance truely admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred? And for diſcipline, I will ſay, I wiſh wee had the execution of ſo much as the Church alloweth. Or, when did the Lord give us a bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce? Or, what Church hath convinced us, that wee cannot bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for a true Church? If they ſay, they of the Separation have; I anſwer; 1 They have laboured to diſcover ſome errors, but none fundamental in us, nor without as many in themſelves. 2 Wee may well doubt whether they bee a Church, or no, ſeeing by the profeſſion of ſome of their Teachers, they will not joyn themſelves to any Church at this day upon the face of the earth, and ſo renounce all Communion with all the parts of the Catholike Church in the world. But wee muſt not think much, if ſome unſtable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons forſake our Communion, ſeeing in the golden and flouriſhing age of the Apoſtles themſelves, ſome ſuch there were, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25.</p>
                     <p>As for our ſelves, wee may ſtrengthen our ſelves againſt them by theſe concluſions. 1 Wee know, that the word of Truth is truly preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, which appeareth by the daily converſion of thouſands, whereas never was man converted by a word of error, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. 2 Wee know, that our Miniſters are of God, becauſe by them ſo many are begotten to God: Our Saviour thought this a good reaſon, when hee ſaid, <hi>Beleeve mee that I came out from the Father, for the works ſake.</hi> The blinde man had good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into this matter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.30. ſaying, <hi>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing:</hi> and a wonderful thing it is, that yee know not whence hee is, and yet hee hath opened mine eyes. So may I ſay to the ſeparatiſt, Doeſt thou not know whence that Miniſter is, who hath opened thine eyes? 3 We know that our meetings are holy meetings: 1 Our people is outwardly called by an holy calling, and to an holy end: 2 They profeſs faith in Chriſt, which is an holy profeſſion, and in charity, (if wee ſee no open raigning ſin) are to bee judged Saints: 3 Congregations are called holy in the Scripture from the better part, not from the greater, as an heap of wheat, mingled and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with chaffe, yet it is called wheat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.

If it bee ſaid, They knew him not ſo to bee, then belike a man may receive the Sacrament fruitfully of a ſecret prophane man or infidel, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Miniſter (if it bee ſecret) pollutes not the Sacrament; and then it muſt follow neceſſarily, that no comfort and truth of the Sacrament can depend upon any Miniſter; for then none could have any aſſured comfort, that they have ever received a Sacrament, becauſe no man can look to the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of any mans heart, and cannot certainly without revelation know who is indeed truely ſanctified.</p>
                     <p>Object. 3 <hi>But what ſay you to a dumb Miniſter? hee is no Miniſter, and therefore hee can perform no miniſterial action: his Baptiſm, is no Baptiſme; his Sacraments, no Sacraments; his prayers, no Prayers.</hi>

Being thus enabled by the Church to give what they can, and bound by being in the place of a Paſtor, though he come never ſo inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to adminiſter Sacraments, we may receive from him what hee can give. 5 Wee muſt diſtinguiſh between a calling, and the execution of it; for it proves not he hath no calling of a Miniſter, becauſe hee executeth it not.

So at the Lords Table: ſuch as admit wicked perſons, having power to repel them, communicate with their ſin and countenance them therein: but a private perſon, whoſe ſoul is vexed with their ſin, and doth what he can to redreſs it, but cannot, is not polluted by them; hee is forced to eat with them, he may not ſtarve his ſoul.</p>

This doctrin teacheth us, that the way to ſanctifie a mans perſon or family, is to ſet up the Worſhip of God in his heart or houſe. 1 Thy heart muſt be the Temple of God, yea as the Ark within the Sanctuary: In the Temple God was daily worſhipped, there were daily Sacrifices offered, the Scriptures read and expounded, and prayers preferred unto God from his people. Thou muſt get proportion in all theſe, if thy heart be Gods Temple: thou muſt privately, yea ſecretly apart daily worſhip God with perſonal worſhip, daily offer the ſacrifices of praiſe and thanks for perſonal bleſſings and deliverances, daily prefer thy perſonal prayers, daily apart read and apply the Scriptures to thine own uſe: for thus muſt it be in Gods temple. And further, thy heart muſt be as the Ark, wherein were kept the Tables of the Law, written with Gods own finger: endeavour in obedience to all Gods Commandements, intreat God to write his Law in thy heart, that thou mayeſt never depart from it. Thy heart as the Ark, muſt keep the pot of Manna, a type of Chriſt the food of life; cloſe Chriſt within thy heart, and hold him as thy life never to part with him: for that figured the Sacraments, in which Chriſt is propounded the food of the ſoul. Thy heart as the Ark, muſt contain <hi>Aarons</hi> rod that had budded, ſignifying the diſcipline and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt, unto which thou muſt ſubject thy ſelf: let this rod flouriſh in thee, and ſtoop with reverence and fear to this ſcepter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Thy houſe and family muſt be ſanctified alſo, by ſetting up and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gods worſhip there.

It is Gods Commandement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. to whet the law continually on our children, and train them up even from child-hood in the Scriptures. The benefit whereof ſhall bee, 1 To fit them for the publike Miniſtry: 2 To cauſe the word to dwell plentiouſly in them: 3 it is a notable means for their growth in godlineſs, and to contain them in good order.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In calling them to account for things delivered, by catechiſing, pittifully neglected in families, who yet would be thought to bee Gods people.

So in the New-Teſtament, The Miniſter that rules well, is worthy of double honour: Yea, if the widows which were ſet apart to inferiour offices about the poor, muſt be honoured, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.3. much more the Miniſter that ſtandeth in Gods place and ſtead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.

                     <p n="2">2 Some places are for their uſe to bee accounted holy, becauſe God is there preſent in his worſhip, as the places of our meetings; not that any inherent holineſs is annexed to the place, or cleaveth to it out of the action of Gods worſhip; but while God is preſent in his Worſhip, wee muſt account it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground, and the houſe of God. When God appeared in <hi>Bethel</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> hee ſaid, <hi>How fearful is this place? ſurely it is no other than the houſe of God.</hi> Wee muſt therefore put off our ſhooes with <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is, our baſe and vile, our ſinful and ſenſual affections, yea, our lawful (if earthly) thoughts, when wee come to this holy place. Look wee bring no thoughts with us unbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the place where God is, ſeparated from other common places to holy uſes. Look that in this place wee uſe no geſture or behaviour, unbeſeeming a man that hath buſineſs with God being preſent. To ſit talking, or ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or laughing, or gazing, ſutes not with this place. And further, if God pleaſe to account the very places holy for the uſe, and preſence of God in this uſe; what ſhall wee think of them that conceive ſo baſely of them, as they would love a Pariſh better, in which is no Church? Others prophane them with baſe practices, and unconſcionably ſuffer them to fall or decay, and will bee at no charge to make or keep them handſome, ſweet, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

                     <p n="3">3 The holy Ordinances of God muſt not bee touched but with holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence: of which it is ſaid, It is not ſafe to play with holy things: 1 The word muſt bee received, read, heard, ſpoken, as the holy word of God. To make jeſts of Scripture is a wicked practice. God looks graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly on him that trembles at his word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. as good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> whoſe heart melted, hearing the words of the Law. So the names and attributes of God, are never to bee uſed in frivolous admirations; but <hi>every knee muſt bow unto him, Phil.</hi> 2.10. Neither ought wee to laugh at Gods judgements on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 An Oath is one of the holy Ordinances of God; and to ſwear in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talk vainly, is not to ſhew reverence to this holy Ordinance. <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> that is, uncalled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34, 35. neither being called, but in truth, juſtice, and judgement: for an Oath is appointed to decide controverſies, which other means cannot. How few conſider whether the matter bee worth an Oath, or whether they bee called to it, or whether it might not have been better paſſed by <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay,</hi> or by a bare aſſeveration? A wicked man is deſcribed by being a Swearer, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.3. but a godly man not only not ſwears, from which a man by education or civility may abſtain, but alſo <hi>fears an oath,</hi> in what company ſoever hee is, or what occaſion ſoever hee hath.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 A Lot is another ſpecial Ordinance of God, to decide a controverſy from heaven by God himſelf, when all means on earth fail. Therefore Lots muſt not be uſed without great reverence and prayer, becauſe the diſpoſition of them commeth immediately from the Lord, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.33. and not but in great matters, not for recreation: for it is ſaid, to cauſe contentious to ceaſe among the mighty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.18. neither do wee read that it was ever uſed, but in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great things, as the dividing of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the election of High Prieſts and Kings, and the ſurrogation of <hi>Matthias</hi> into the place of <hi>Judas.</hi> Hence it follows, if dice and cards bee Lots (as I think they bee) that all play by them is unlawful.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Some times are ſanctified above other, as the Sabbath day, all which muſt bee paſſed holily, with much reverence and reſpect, both remembring it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come, yea, rejoycing in the approach of it; and when it is come, to ſanctify it; 1 In our hearts: for external obſervation of the Sabbath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inward holineſs and affection to the duties of Gods ſervice, is hypocriſy.

The like (if not more) may be ſaid againſt pampering a mans ſelf and others, by feeding or feaſting, and of drinking, or any ſuch wicked paſſing away the Sabbath.

Surely, becauſe the cauſe of this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ceaſed; the worſhip of God was corrupted, the Son of God deſpighted, the Goſpel of God rejected, the Saints of God murthered, the day of Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neglected. And therefore, they being infinitely departed from God, and his pure worſhip, God departs from them; and God being gone, the place ceaſeth to be holy; <hi>Bethel,</hi> while the viſion of the Ladder laſted there, was an holy place, and ſo long as Gods Worſhip continued there: but when it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The evil ſucceſs of ſuch Battels ever ſhewed, how God was offended with ſuch ſuperſtitious warres: and another miſchief by them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Chriſtian world to keep it in blindneſs: For the Pope making his advantage of this blinde devotion, if any King or Prince in Chriſtendom ſtood between him and his proceedings, one way or other he would ſend him out of his own Country in expedition for the Holy Warre, and there hold him till he had effected his own deſigns in that Princes Country, and ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf in all Lands, as Hiſtories manifeſt.</p>

Let us not bear our ſelves as though we had God ſo ſure, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt thinks he hath him in a Box, or pretend any vain priviledge that we have to exempt us from danger: True it is, we have the word with peace, liberty, and protection: but the fear is, that our ſecurity and deadneſs of heart, with diſſoluteneſs and prophaneneſs in behaviour, will forfeit all. God ſendeth <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> to <hi>Shilo,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Truſt not in lying words, ſaying,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 7.4, 12</note> 
                        <hi>The Temple of the Lord; but amend your wayes, and I will let you dwell in this place: but if you will not, goe to</hi> Shilo, <hi>and ſee what I did to it, and look for the like.</hi> So now God ſends us to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that we may conſider what he did to it, being once the praiſe of the earth: and if the ſame ſins be found in us as were in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Lord will doe no other with us, than he did with it; even as he threatned, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.13. he will ſtretch over us the line of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that is, bring the enemy in our necks; and the plummet of the houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> an Idolater; take away his holy things, and exchange them with filthy Idolatry, and wipe us as a man wipeth a diſh, even turn us upſide down. What were the ſins of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> but pride, idleneſs, fulneſs of bread, and contempt of the poor? In all which <hi>England</hi> doth equal, if not goe beyond <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and yet wee charge our ſelves as little with our ſins as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did. And if wee look to the immediate cauſes and fore-runners of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> over-throw, and compare them with our Land, wee ſhall ſee it high time to look about us: for,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. In general, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had grievouſly ſinned, and therefore was had in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.8. Her ſins were great, many, of long continuance, with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured wrath; and all this in a place of ſuch means and light. Now no place in the world hath more means than wee, wee are farre beyond <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in means, and therefore farre beyond her in ſins.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. More ſpecially: 1 They did not hear the words of Gods ſervants the Prophets, nor obey them; therefore the Lord made that houſe like to <hi>Shilo,</hi> Jerem. 26.6. and hence <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> afterward had time enough, but too late to charge her ſelf with rebellion, <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.18. and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the righteous judgement of God againſt it. Never were the Oracles of Heathens deſpiſed ſo amongſt them, as Gods holy Word is generally of our people; no man almoſt lets it come near his heart, a manifeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God will one day ſpeak ſo as hee will bee heard. <hi>A Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> would not take knowledge of the day of her Viſitation, as appears in <hi>Luke</hi> 19.43. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. therefore her habitation was made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate. As little know we the worth of our bleſſed means: but perhaps wee may know it better in the want of them. 3 <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> remembred not her latter end, therefore ſhe came down wonderfully, <hi>Lam</hi> 1.9. ſhe was careleſs and never conſidered the account ſhe was to make of her liberties, and ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her ſelf in ſin, and grew to contemn the good means ſhee had, through the daily cuſtom of them. This alſo was the immediate fore-runner of <hi>Ninivehs</hi> deſtruction, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.13. This is the rejoycing City,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40284:65"/> that dwelt careleſs and ſaid in her heart, I am, and there is none beſide mee. How is ſhee made waſt, and the lodging of beaſts? Every one that paſſeth by her, ſhall hiſs and wag his head. And the reaſon is, ſhee bore her ſelf upon her priviledges, her holy things, her ſtrength, wealth, populous and flouriſhing eſtate, ſpecially upon the Promiſes of God, which they perverted, being all made with condition of obedience, which they had long before for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited: yea, ſo likely and conſtant an eſtate ſhee had, as none in the world would have beleeved, that the enemy ſhould have entered the gates of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Lam.</hi> 4.12. ſo as hee came unlookt for. The ſame is our conceit, wee think our ſtaffe ſo ſtrong that it can never bee broken, wee remember not what is the end of ſecurity: when men cry, Peace, Peace, comes ſudden war.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had two ſorts of Prophets in her: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Falſe Prophets, which flattered them, and ſought out vain things, falſe propheſies and cauſes of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.14. Such was <hi>Hanani,</hi> who oppoſed <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and ſaid the Lord would within two years break the yoke of the King of <hi>Babel, Jer.</hi> 28.2. and <hi>Ahabs</hi> falſe Prophets would bid the King go up to battle againſt Gods Commandement, and proſper. This was one cauſe of her ruine, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.13. for the ſins of her Prophets and Prieſts: not that the people had not ſinned, but when Leaders, and ſuch as ſhould preſerve purity of Religion and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are ſo corrupt, it argues a general corruption running down from the head to all the members, which muſt needs bring the whole to a conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>A ſecond</hi> ſort were faithful and ſincere, and the entertainment of theſe was ſuch in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as God moſt ſeverely revenged. <hi>Jeremy</hi> was caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dungeon, <hi>Micaiah</hi> into priſon, nay, our Saviour challengeth <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of ſuch cruelty againſt the Prophets, as did bring all the righteous blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them from <hi>Abel</hi> unto <hi>Zachariah, Mat.</hi> 23.37. But of all cruelty they filled their meaſure in crucifying the Lord of the holy Prophets. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.38. the Houſholder ſent his ſervants to receive fruits, but they evil-intreated them, and beat ſome, and ſlew others; at laſt hee ſent his Son, ſaying, They will ſurely reverence my Son: but they ſaid, This is the Heir. Come let us kill him, and the inheritance ſhall bee ours. Now what will the Houſholder do? He will certainly deſtroy thoſe wicked men, and let out his vineyard to others. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing plainly in this parable, Gods dealing with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and theirs with him, and what was the immediate cauſe of their deſtruction. A dangerous thing it is to wrong the faithful Miniſters of God: <hi>Do my Prophets no harm,</hi> ſaith the Lord: and to perſecute Chriſt in his members, ſhall not bee unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had many warnings before their utter overthrow. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiedged by <hi>Pharaoh Necho,</hi> by <hi>Senachetib</hi> in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, in <hi>Rhehoboams</hi> time, by <hi>Shiſhac</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it was ſacked and overthrown, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.26. It was ſubdued thrice by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babel,</hi> twice under <hi>Joakim,</hi> and the third time under <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> the City was waſted, the Temple burnt, and the people captivated into <hi>Babylon,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 24. and 25 After ſeventy years, when by the permiſſion of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Temple was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> the City by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the law reſtored by <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the Lord came again to his Temple: yet being again provoked, ſome years after it was taken by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> the Law burned, the Temple prophaned, the daily ſacrifice removed, the ſanctuary of ſtrength polluted, and the abomination of deſolation ſet up, as <hi>Daniel</hi> had foretold, chap. 11. v. 31. and made a wonderful effuſion of blood. After this, the City and Temple was re-edifyed by <hi>Judas Aſſomanaeus,</hi> and began to flouriſh: but it was not long, before it was again taken by <hi>Cu. Pompeius,</hi> a Romane Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whom <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> called to help him againſt his brother <hi>Hircanus,</hi> for the Prieſthood. All theſe were fair warnings, whence they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40284:65"/> 1 How righteous the Lord was in not forbearing their ſins: 2 With how little reaſon they could ſtand upon any outward priviledge, if they would go on in provoking the Lord: 3 How loath the Lord was to reject them utterly, if by any means they could bee reclaimed. But when no means would do them good, the Lord gives them to utterdeſolation by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> who ruinated the City, defaced the Temple, and left not one ſtone upon another, as Chriſt propheſied, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.2. And ſince that time it hath ever been prophaned, and in the hands of the greateſt enemies of God and man, next Satan himſelf; polluted with moſt horrible idolatries, the Jews driven from thence into all Lands, and in all Lands Vagabonds, the blood of the Sonne of God lying upon them and their children till this day.</p>
                     <p>Oh the patience of God toward us! the many warnings and threatnings that wee have had, by many treaſons, conſpiracies, ſundry open and ſecret practices of our enemies, by Sea and by Land! (Remember 88. and 1605.) by ſundry plagues of many kinds, and every day renewed, renews ſome warning or other: And yet, how fall wee back more and more? how ſtrong are the Papiſts? how bold? how malicious and furious, as maſtives that have been long in the chain? Oh that wee were ſo wiſe, rather to take example by others, than to bee made examples to others; and to take warning by others harms to prevent our own! Why ſhould wee think our ſelves ſo ſafe from the touch of this doctrin, or exempted from the lot of all Churches and Lands? Where was there ever a more holy place, a more holy City, a more holy Temple, than at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> yet by ſecurity depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Lord, the Lord left them. What Church in all the World, whoſe flouriſhing eſtate hath alwaies laſted? Caſt wee our eyes upon the Churches planted by the Apoſtles themſelves, that of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a, Epheſus,</hi> the Churches in <hi>Aſia:</hi> they had their times, but knew it not till it was too late: now all are become dens of theeves, and ſunk down into the deadly poyſon either of Mahometiſme or Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
                     <p>It was the over-ſight, and overthrow of the moſt renowned Churches, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver long to prize their liberties in the preſence of them, but had leave a long time to bewail their abſence. Time was when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had God near them, his Prophets, his Law and Oracles, her Nazarites purer than ſnow: But not long after, there was never a Prophet left, never a ſign, her Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites blacker than a coal, the waies of <hi>Sion</hi> forſaken: Oh now for one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet more! Time was, when they had the Son of God among them, and his Apoſtles, and the ſound of the bleſſed Goſpel was firſt offered to them: But not long after, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the note was altred, and the caſe changed: for the ſons of peace, and the Miniſters of peace, they hear of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> of wars, and blood-ſhed, of famine and death meeting them a thouſand waies.</p>
                     <p>Now time is, wee have God near us, and Chriſt his Son, and the Miniſters of reconciliation, and wee know not our happineſs. Time may come, when wee may wiſh one good Miniſter in a Country, one Sermon, one holy Sabbath ſpent as we have ſeen many with too much neglect: A Lent may come for this long ope-tide. The Lord knows how little wee deſire the day of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, neither can wee propheſy; but bleſſed is that man that <hi>ſeeth the plague and hideth himſelf, where as the fool muſt go on to puniſhment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE ſecond thing in this ſecond circumſtance, is the ſpecial place, namely <hi>The Pinacle of the Temple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Temple was the higheſt place on the Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> and the pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was the higheſt place of the Temple, to wit, a battlement above the top, to keep from falling down, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.8. called pinacles from their ſharpeneſs,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40284:66"/> as our pinacles are the ſharpe tops of our buildings, or ſpires.</p>
                     <p>Satan makes choice of this place; 1 As fit to his temptation, the ſcope and aim whereof wee ſhall ſee afterward. 2 Beginning a new temptation, hee changeth his place, to ſee if thereby hee can change Chriſts minde: ſo did <hi>Balaam,</hi> to ſee if any place would ſerve him to curſe Gods people, ſhift from place to place. And it is not unlike but our Dicers and Gameſters have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this of the Devil, when the play runnes againſt them, to ſhift places for better luck, as they ſay. 3 The place was full of danger to ſtand upon, and much more for the height to fall from. 4 The Temple was an holy place, dedicated to Gods worſhip and ſervice; what hath Satan to do there? but hee takes upon him, as though hee had to do every where, and can ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Sons of God, againſt the ſons of God. It may bee Chriſt will think himſelf priviledged there, as the Pope in his chair, that he cannot erre what ever hee do. Or if hee can abuſe the Temple, to make it a means of the overthrow of the Son of God, hee ſhall with one work both diſhonor the Father ſo much the more, and deſtroy the Son.</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>Satan either fits his temptation according to the place where hee finds a man, or draws him to a place fit for his temptation:</hi> Both which wee ſee here againſt Chriſt; being in the wilderneſs hungry, Satan fits his temptation to the place, to make ſtones bread; and now being to aſſail him with another kind of temptation, hee draws him into a place fit for his temptation. This ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety of Satan wee may obſerve in the firſt temptation of all: there was but one forbidden tree in Paradiſe, and there Satan fits his temptation to the place, <hi>to eat of that.</hi> So hee findes <hi>Peter</hi> in the common hall, there hee tempts him to deny his Maſter, a place moſt fit for it, where all elſe deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abuſed him; and, if hee ſhould not do ſo, hee ſhould bee in like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Nay, hee not onely fitted the temptation, but alſo drew <hi>Peter</hi> to the place.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Satan doth not uſe all temptations in every place, but ſuch as hee will have ſome advantage in by the very place it ſelf: hee knows it were bootleſs, if the place as well as other circumſtances bee not fitted to him. It had been in vain to have tempted <hi>Cain</hi> to ſtay <hi>Abel</hi> in his fathers houſe: but he drew him into the field after him, and ſo prevailed. Hee knew <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a moſt modeſt and chaſt man, and it had been in vain to have moved him to uncleanneſs, ſo openly as hee did <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>bi</hi> at the door of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Congregation, or as openly as <hi>Abſalom,</hi> who defiled his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Concubines in the ſight of all <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and therefore hee ſets upon him in a ſecret chamber. Hee knew it was no fit place to tempt <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, in the middeſt of the waters, when there ſeemed but a ſtep between him and death: but, ſitting under the vine, in his vineyard, hee was eaſily overcome with it. While <hi>David</hi> was in his flight before <hi>Saul,</hi> in Caves and Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, it was bootleſs to tempt him to folly, hee had no leiſure, his thoughts were taken up in holy Prayers and Conſultations with God; but when hee was on his Pinacle, on the top of his turret, the place was fit to ſpye <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and have her fetcht to him, and ſo the ſin was finiſhed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Satan knows, that ſins are of divers ſorts, and though all bee works of darkneſs, and ſo ſhould fly the light, and walk in ſolitary and private pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as extremities on the left hand, thefts, murders, Adulteries, &amp;c. yet ſome other are beſt brooded in the light and places of publike reſort, as Pride, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, and a number of riots and open diſorders: for example; <hi>Herod</hi> ſwore an Oath to give <hi>Herodias</hi> whatſoever ſhee asked, to half his kingdom: when ſhee asked <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> head (which was an heinous murder of them both upon an innocent man) the very fitneſs of the place brought it forth.

So how dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do men run into great Papiſts houſes, where there are a thouſand allurements, and inticements, pure Religion ſcorned, belied, and all to be beſmeared with ſhameful lies, and opprobry, and the contrary magnified and extolled as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truth; yea, the Scriptures themſelves not leſſe abhorred than the Theif hates the Gallows, and thruſt down under mens deviſes and Popes Decrees, yea, the word of Salvation condemned and burnt (as they were of old by <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> and <hi>Maximinus</hi>) as the books of Hereticks; and the godly profeſſors ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed under the ſtile of Scripturers and Bible-bearers?

                        <hi>Took him up, and ſet him on the pinacle.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third circumſtance in this preparation, is the manner how Chriſt was conveyed to <hi>Jeruſalem; Then the Devil took him up into the holy City, and ſet him on a pinacle of the Temple.</hi> Some of great Learning and Piety hold, that Chriſts preſence in the holy City, and on the Pinacle, was only in Viſion, and not corporal. Their reaſons are theſe: 1. Some of the Prophets thus are ſaid in viſion to goe from place to place; as <hi>Jeremy</hi> muſt goe to the river <hi>Perath,</hi> and back again, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.4. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.24. <hi>The Spirit of God took me up, and brought me in a viſion by the Spirit of God into</hi> Chaldea: and, 8.3. <hi>And took me by an hairy lock of my head, and the Spirit lift me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me by a Divine viſion to</hi> Jeruſalem. 2 Becauſe the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſay, that the temptations were in the Wilderneſs, and therefore could not be actually in the holy City, or on a pinacle, but in viſion. 3 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, that the temptations being ended, Chriſt returned into <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> namely from the wilderneſs.</p>
                     <p>But it ſeems, Chriſts being in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and on the Pinacle of the Temple, was not in viſion, but in deed and in truth; and the reaſons well conſidered are too weak to prove the contrary: becauſe, 1 It overthrows the end of the temptation, which was to caſt himſelf down head-long, for the Angels would keep him without hurt. How could hee hurt himſelf by an imaginary fall? or what needed he the Angels help? Neither could hee caſt himſelf down, if he were ſtill in the plain of the wilderneſs. 2 It ſeems not to ſtand with the holineſs of Chriſt, ſeeing every viſion, which is a work of Satan, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending by it to delude man, is either a deceiving of the outward ſenſes, (whereby he makes a man think he ſees, hears, or feels ſomething, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and truth he doth not: as the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> made <hi>Saul</hi> beleeve hee did hear and ſee <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he did not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. And after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40284:68"/> if it were a viſion, ſuppoſing that Chriſt was awake, he muſt not ſee the ground of the Wilderneſs, where they ſay he was, but upon that ground the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Temple, and Pinacle, and himſelf ſtanding on the top of it, when indeed it was not there:) Or elſe, a viſion preſented by Satan muſt bee an illuſion of the mind, whereby he makes a man think that of himſelf which is not true; which can farre leſs agree with the holineſs of Chriſt, whoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination could not be ſo farre abuſed, as that he ſhould think he was carried, when he was not carried; or to think himſelf to be there, where he was not: for this were contrary to that unmeaſurable wiſdom, which was with him. And if Satan had had ſuch power over the ſuperiour part of the mind of Chriſt he might likewiſe have perſwaded him he had not fallen when hee did fall, or he did not worſhip him, if he had done ſo.</p>
                     <p>As for the Objection taken from the example of the Prophets;</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, Great is the difference between the viſions of God, and viſions from Satan. They knew their viſions to be Divine, and not to delude or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, they knew the Spirit of God took them up in Divine viſions; but here it is ſaid, <hi>The Devil took up Chriſt;</hi> and the text mentioneth that theirs were viſions, ſo it doth not here.</p>
                     <p>For that which is objected out of the Evangeliſts, that the temptations were in the Wilderneſs, and if it were not in viſion, only the firſt ſhould be there:</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, 1 The Evangeliſts ſay, that Chriſt went into the Wilderneſs to be tempted, but none of them ſay, that all theſe three were in the wilderneſs. 2 If they ſhould have ſaid, that the temptations were in the wilderneſs, it had been true: for (as we have heard) Chriſt was tempted with other temptations than theſe in that place within the forty days.</p>
                     <p>Whereas it is further ſaid, that Chriſt returned after the temptations into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and therefore the laſt temptation was in viſion upon the Plain, and not on the Mountain:</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, 1 No one Evangeliſt ſaith, he returned from the Wilderneſs. 2 That the Evangeliſt hath reference to the laſt temptation, which perhaps was finiſhed in the Mountain, either in that Wilderneſs, or near it, after Chriſt was led back from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there the temptations ended.</p>
                     <p>And now, ſeeing that his preſence in the holy City, and upon the Pinacle was real and local, not in viſion and mental, the next queſtion is, <hi>How the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil took him up, and ſet him on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It muſt neceſſarily be one of theſe two wayes; either Satan muſt lead him, or elſe muſt carry him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The former,</hi> that Satan took him as a Companion, or a Leader, ſeems not ſo probable: 1 Becauſe Chriſt of his own will would not goe; for (as wee have heard) the Spirit led him into the Wilderneſs to bee tempted; and hee would not of himſelf goe elſewhere, becauſe the Spirit of God called him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and no whither elſe. 2 Chriſt would not doe it at Satans inſtigation, whom he knew to be the Tempter: for neither muſt we doe any thing at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans requeſt, be it never ſo lawful: for whatever wee doe, wee muſt have a word of God to doe it in faith. 3 If Chriſt had yeelded to be lead as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, he might have ſeemed to have ſought temptation, and been a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker with Satan againſt himſelf: but it was enough to yeeld himſelf a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in it. 4 The diſtance of the holy City from the Wilderneſs, which was (as thoſe ſay that make it the leaſt) twelve miles from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> admitteth not that Chriſt being hungry and ready to faint, ſhould follow Satan ſo many miles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The latter</hi> therfore ſeems to be the right manner of Chriſts conveiance, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was carried by Satan through the air, who by Gods and Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40284:68"/> took him up, and tranſported his bleſſed body to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſet him on the battlements of the Temple, For, 1 The words, <hi>he ſet him on the Temple,</hi> ſignifies he ſet him down, who had formerly taken him up; and if he had power to ſet him there, why ſhould he not alſo have power to carry him thither? And, if he had not carried him thither, but Chriſt had followed him the Evangeliſt would have ſaid, <hi>When they came to the pinacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and not <hi>ſet him on the pinacle.</hi> 2 This was the hour of the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein Satan was allowed to take all advantages to further his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and he might think this violent tranſportation a means, <hi>either</hi> of ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts faith with terror and fear what might become of him, being now delivered into the hands of Satan; <hi>or elſe</hi> to make him ſwell with pride and inſolency, that he was able to flie in the air, or to be conveyed in the air from place to place, without hurt, which an ordinary man could not: and this would well fit the ſcope of the temptation enſuing.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how could Satan carry the body of Chriſt, being a ſpirit? Or if he could, why ſhould hee?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hee is a Spirit, 1 Of wonderful knowledge and experience, to dive into ſecrets of Nature, to work ſtrange and hidden things. 2 Of exceeding great power, to ſhake the Earth, move the mountains, and confound the Creatures, if God ſhould not reſtrain him. 3 Of Admirable agility and quickneſs, proceeding from his ſpiritual nature, whereby hee can ſpeedily convey himſelf, and other creatures, into places far remote and diſtant one from another. 4 Hee knows to apply himſelf to the creatures, and to move them, not onely according to their ordinary courſe, but with much more ſpeed and quickneſs. 5 Hee is able to appear in the form of a creature, or any perſon, not by deluding ſenſes, but by aſſuming to himſelf a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and move it by entring into it, and to utter a voice in a known Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as hee did in <hi>the Serpent,</hi> and ſo hee can in other creatures, which have inſtruments of ſpeech. And thus it is not difficult to him to tranſport a body.</p>
                     <p>Witches and Wiſards have been often by their own confeſſion tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into remote places by wicked ſpirits, which they call familiars. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, good Angels (being in their nature Spirits as Satan is) are able to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port men hither and thither, as Chriſt was in the air. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.39. The Spirit of the Lord caught away <hi>Philip,</hi> and carried him from <hi>Gaza</hi> to <hi>Azotus,</hi> which was about thirty ſix miles. Some underſtand it of an Angel of the Lord, as Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> noteth. But if God by himſelf miraculouſly did that, the additions to <hi>Daniel</hi> (to which as much credit is to bee given, as to any Hiſtory, which is not Scripture) affirm, that the Angel of the Lord carried <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> out of <hi>Judea</hi> into <hi>Babylon</hi> by the hair of the head.</p>
                     <p>Now, why muſt Chriſt be thus carried by Satan?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 It was not againſt the will of Chriſt, but willingly hee puts himſelf into the hands of the Devil, to pluck us out of his hands. 2 It was not impotency or weakneſſe of Chriſt, but power and reſolution, who would not recoil, nor ſhun any place where Satan would appoint for his aſſault, or would carry him, being as well the God of the Mountains as of the Vallies. Here therefore wee muſt not admire the power of Satan, but the patience of Chriſt, that ſuffered himſelf to bee carried of the Devil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it tended to the greater confuſion of Satan, and the glory of his own vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. 3 Our bleſſed Lord would be tempted in all things like unto us, that as a careful <hi>Head</hi> hee might ſympathize with his members. God for the tryal of his children, ſometimes ſuffers Satan to have power even over their bodies: and therefore Chriſt to ſanctify this affliction to his members, would ſuffer even his own bleſſed body for a while in the hands of Satan. 4 What marvel if Chriſt ſuffred himſelf to bee carried by the Devil to temptation, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40284:69"/> ſuffered himſelf to bee carried by his inſtruments to execution? How was hee haled and carried by the Devils limbs from place to place, from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> from him to <hi>Pilate,</hi> from him to <hi>Herod,</hi> from him to <hi>Pilate</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and from him to the place of execution? Satan in himſelf might as well carry his body into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be tempted, as his limbs carry it out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to bee crucified; and as well might he ſuffer Satan to lead him into the mountain, and tempt him, as his inſtruments to lead his body unto Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> to kill him.</p>

Hee knew it was a part of that whole <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> which hee was to fulfil, and therefore hee reſiſteth not. Hee knew it to bee as great an indignity as never could bee the like; yet for our ſakes hee is well content with it.</p>
                     <p>Now as Chriſt was content, becauſe hee loved us, thus to bee toſſed of Satan here, and of his inſtruments afterwards, ſo let us ſhew or return our love to him. If wee be toſſed by Satan, or by his inſtruments, for Chriſts ſake, as the Saints have been, from Priſon to Priſon, wee muſt bee contented: our Love to our Lord muſt help us to ſwallow it, and not ſhrink from him. Conſider, wee may bee in the hands of the Devils inſtruments, but hee was in the Devils own hands for us: this would make us ſhrink.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Obſerve hence, <hi>That the work of our redemption, though free to us, yet coſt Chriſt dear.</hi> Hee muſt bee not onely in the hands of <hi>Judas</hi> to betray him, of the Jews to ſcoffe him, of <hi>Pilate</hi> to condemn him, and of the Souldiers to crucify him; but perſonally in the hands of the Devil to tempt him. And had not Chriſt been thus, and worſe than thus, in the hands of the Devil, wee had never been gotten out of his hands. Here take wee notice of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecration of our ſins, and the wofulneſſe of our eſtate: our ſins put him into Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans hands, he muſt put himſelf in our place or ſtead, before we can bereſcued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Obſerve <hi>The wonderful power of our Lord Jeſus, that being in the bands of the Devil, can come out ſafely:</hi> nay, his mighty power ſhines herein, that by his own comming into Satans hands hee brings us out, an unlikely and contrary means, but ſuch as by a divine power prevails for himſelf and all his members. Could any other but hee worke Satans greateſt diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by offering him the greateſt advantage? Here is omnipotency to work by contraries, to kill death by dying, to ſhut the grave by entring into it, to remove helliſh pains by ſuffering them, and to pull his members out of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans hands by putting himſelf in. The <hi>Philiſtims</hi> deſired but to get <hi>Sampſon</hi> into their hands, and prevailed: but here is an invincible <hi>Sampſon,</hi> his enemy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Hence wee ſee that Satan may have power over the bodies of men, God permitting him, to carry them as hee liſteth, and grievouſly to afflict them, as wee ſee in <hi>Job.</hi> That Satan can tranſport the bodies of Witches, all Hiſtories record. That hee can bewitch the bodies of unbeleevers, none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But our example teacheth, that even the godly themſelves may bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched; as <hi>Jobs</hi> body was, and the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> her daughter, a daughter of <hi>Abraham, Matth.</hi> 15.22. For if the Devil hath power here over the Body of Chriſt himſelf, hee may alſo over his members. Many preſume upon the ſtrength of their faith and graces, that Satan can have no power over them, and they defye him: But haſt thou more
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40284:69"/> ſtrength of Faith and Grace than Chriſt had, over whoſe body Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had power for a time to carry and recarry.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Witches have aſſaied to bewitch ſuch and ſuch, but have confeſſed their faith to be ſo ſtrong as they could not prevail.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> They alledge a falſe cauſe to feed the former deluſion: for the true cauſe of their not prevailing is Gods reſtraint, not the ſtrength of faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 5. Here is a ground of comfort, if the Lord permit the bodies of his elect to Satans diſpoſal, it is no argument (ſuppoſe a man be bewitched or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed) that a man is not then the child of God: For 1 Chriſt was as dear unto God now, being in the Devils hands, as before. 2 Chriſt was ſafe enough now in the hands of the Devil, and ſo are all they that are in Chriſt. He was no leſſe in his fathers hands now than before. 3 He was not left in the hands of the Devil, but permitted for a time of trial and temptation: So it is no argument of final delivery up to Satan, when the child of God is for a time delivered into his hands to exerciſe him. 4 It is rather an argument of Gods child, and conformity with Chriſt, to be maligned of Satan and vexed by the Devil. Satan may winnow and ſiſt Gods children, but their faith through Chriſts prayer ſhall not fail, and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail.</p>

                     <p>NOw after thoſe three former circumſtances, which contained the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to this ſecond temptation, wee come to the temptation it ſelf; which conſiſts of 1 The aſſault; 2 The repulſe.

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 The ground <hi>(If thou be the Son of God)</hi> is the ſame with the former: which ſheweth, 1 Satans importunity and violence, 2 His ſubtilty: by often making queſtion of it he will ſee if hee can yet bring Chriſt to make it a queſtion. 3 His malice againſt Chriſt, laying ſtill his greateſt forces againſt his ſaith, which was the greateſt moat in his eye: dealing herein like an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Souldier, who ſeeing a Town or Fort in any hope to be won, will not away at firſt repulſe, but will aſſay it again and again with new aſſaults. Whence we may learn, that,</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>Satan will not ſticke to urge the ſame thing often, if thereby hee may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage himſelf, or diſadvantage us.</hi> With how many new meſſages and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did he urge <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe the people of God? Still hee changeth places, but all is one temptation, to curſe the people of God. By how many means did Satan by himſelf, by <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, and his Wife, ſeek to with-draw him from his confidence in God, bringing a number of ſeveral arguments, and all to prove him an Hypocrite? For that was the foot and burden of all their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It may be the circumſtances of time or place may yeeld him ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as here hee thought the Pinacle fitter than the Wilderneſs: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
                        </label> as <hi>Balaak</hi> thought the top of <hi>Piſgah</hi> more commodious perhaps for <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> in, than the high places of <hi>Baal,</hi> Numb. 23.14. compared with 22.41.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Sometimes our diſpoſition is more ſecure and remiſs, eſpecially having out-ſtood and overcome a temptation; and then Satan comes again, and by the ſame temptation (not finding us the ſame men) ſuddenly ſurprizeth us. Wherein he deals with us as <hi>David</hi> with the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who having took a great ſpoyl from him and his wives, they fell to eat, and drink, and dance, and lay ſcattered becauſe of the prey; In this ſecurity <hi>David</hi> comes upon them;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40284:70"/> and recovered all, and they loſt more than they had gotten. So deals Satan with us; when wee grow ſecure (after wee have prevailed) he wins more than before wee had gotten.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Sometime the thing, which Satan would win from us, is ſo neceſſary, ſo excellent, as if hee get not that, hee can gain nothing at our hands. This makes him renew the ſame aſſault, as here; the faith of Chriſt had been a ſweet morſel, and, if hee gets not this, hee gets nothing: So our faith is ſo precious, as hee ſtill aims at it, becauſe hee knows if hee overthrows this, wee are as branches without a root, withering and dead, ſouldiers without a <hi>ſhield.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1 Look for the ſame temptation again and again. The fencer having had a ſhrewd wound, will not eaſily lye open in that part again. The Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who have ſtood out a ſiege, will ſurvey the places moſt battered, where the enemy had his ſtrongeſt hope of entry, and will moſt fortify them againſt another time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Where wee are moſt tempted, know that there is ſome ſpecial grace to bee kept or loſt. A theef will not hanker after an empty cheſt: but if hee know where Jewels or treaſure is, he will haunt there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Abandon all doctrin of doubting as Satanical, which Satan is much and often in, both againſt Chriſt and his members: And no marvel, ſeeing doubting warreth againſt ſaith, by which only Chriſt is apprehended, and heavenly life and heat kept in us. But of this before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. Now follows the matter and ſcope of the temptation, and the dart it ſelf which is thrown at Chriſt. The ſcope of Satan is, 1 To bring Chriſt to preſumption, that ſeeing hee will needs truſt in his Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and care, hee aſſaies if hee can make him truſt too much; and ſeeing hee will bee ſo confident, if hee can bring him to vain confidence: as if hee ſhould ſay, <hi>If thou, becauſe thou art the Son of God, canſt live without bread; upon the ſame ground thou canſt go down without ſtairs.</hi> And both Satans allegation of Scripture, and our Saviours anſwer, ſhew that this was the principal aim of the Devil.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To faſten upon Chriſt vain glory, as well as vain confidence: as if hee ſhould ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt have great honour, and every man will beleeve, if thou by this miracle ſhew thy ſelf the Son of God: to this purpoſe I have fitted the place where is greateſt reſort, and where the Son of God ought especially to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known: For where ſhould the Son bee made known, if not at his Fathers houſe?</hi> Satan knew hee had overcome the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by a temptation of vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and now hee aſſaulteth the ſecond: <hi>Ye ſhall bee gods:</hi> and <hi>Thou ſhalt be known to bee the Son of God, if by flying in the air thou canſt come down without hurt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 To bring him to tempt God, and try whether hee bee ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to ſave him in ſuch an attempt, whether ſo true of his word, as to keep him, and whether the Angels did diligently watch him, and bear him up, as their commiſſion was.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Satan intended directly to kill him, being <hi>a man-ſlayer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> For every way the dart intended his deſtruction, if hee ſhould caſt himſelf down; for thus Satan thought, <hi>If hee caſt down himſelf, and kill himſelf, then hee is not the Son of God, and ſo I ſhall gain him: Or, if hee caſt down himſelf, and not kill himſelf, yet ſhall I make him both diſobey God in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, as alſo obey mee.</hi> Thus either way Satan makes ſure of his prey.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Satan had yet a further fetch, which made him ſo beſtir himſelf, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſts downfall, our utter ruine, diſgrace, and deſtruction. Strike off the head, all the members with that blow are ſlain. The bent of all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40284:70"/> temptations againſt the <hi>Head,</hi> is againſt all the Members. Out of the ſame ground Satan raiſeth a clean contrary temptation to the former. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, hee moves Chriſt to diffidence and deſpair; in this, to preſidence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. In the former, hee would have Chriſt uſe unlawful means; in this, to reject all means, even lawful. In the former, hee perſwades him to diſtruſt where God had promiſed; in this latter, to truſt where God had not promiſed. In the former, that bread was abſolutely neceſſary; here, that a ladder and means of going down, were not neceſſary at all: as if hee ſhould ſay. <hi>Thou ſayeſt that God is able to uphold thee being his ſon, without means; go too, let us ſee how true that is. If hee can ordinarily, and extraordinarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thee, then, Caſt thy ſelf down headlong from this pinacle: for being the ſon of God, thou ſhalt bee ſure to be preſerved ſafe without hurt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Whence Obſerve, <hi>That the Devil in tempting men, labours to bring them to extreams:</hi> And when hee cannot prevail in one, hee would faſten on them the clean contrary ſins. If hee can get Chriſt, becauſe hee is the ſon of God, either to contemn his Fathers providence, as in the former; or to preſume on the ſame, as in this temptation, either will pleaſe him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. the Apoſtle ſheweth, that this is one of the wyles and ſtratagems of Satan, by clean contrary waies to deſtroy the Church: <hi>either</hi> by too much lenity, which let fall the cenſures of the Church, ſo as the inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was not at all corrected; <hi>or</hi> when they began to uſe too much rigour and ſeverity, forgetting the rules of Chriſtian meekneſs and charity. And in the inceſtuous perſon himſelf, it will pleaſe him well, either that hee go on without all remorſe of his ſin, and the Church not meddle with him; or that by the ſeverity of the Church, hee bee ſwallowed up of ſorrow. In regard of both which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are not ignorant of his wyles. Act.</hi> 14.11.19. when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> came to <hi>Lycaonla,</hi> to preach and publiſh the Goſpel, obſerve Satans wyle in the people; either they muſt receive them as Gods, and ſacrifice unto them out of blinde zeal and devotion, at which the Apoſtles rent their cloathes; or elſe they muſt take them and ſtone them, as they did <hi>Paul,</hi> and drew him out of the City, ſuppoſing hee had been dead, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.9. when Chriſt came riding to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> multitudes flocked after him, ſpred their garments in the way, cut down boughs to ſtrow therein, and cried <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> hee was the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> the bleſſed one that came in the Name of the Lord; The people ſaid, it was <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Prophet of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and all the City was moved: But before night, Satan had them in another extremity: ſuch was the envy of the Scribes and Phariſees, that Chriſt was either glad to flye the City that night; or the fear of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that none durſt entertain and lodge him: <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. ſo hee left them, and went into the Town of <hi>Bethania,</hi> and lodged there. And within few daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all cryed, <hi>Crucify, Crucify.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 This comes to paſs, becauſe Satan is contrary to himſelf; <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons </seg>
                        </label> according to his diſpoſition are his waies. Though hee bee the Prince of darkneſs, yet can hee transform himſelf into an Angel of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. Hee appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſhape of a ſerpent to <hi>Eve,</hi> in the ſhape of a Prophet to <hi>Saul.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time this crooked ſerpent can deny Chriſt to be the Son of God, as here; and ſometimes preach him ſo to be, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.24.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 His dexterity and ſlineſs is another cauſe, whereby hee can make one ground, and that a good and true one, to ſerve to rear up two extream evils, in ſuch cunning manner, as hee was in hope to deceive the wiſdome of God himſelf thereby: for here out of Gods word, that Chriſt was his <hi>Son,</hi> hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers two contrary concluſions, both contrary in themſelves, and both contrary to Gods word.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Hee knows, there is but one good and ſtrait way to heaven, that the Lord hath commanded us to walk in that way without turning to the right
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40284:71"/> or left hand, that hee hath placed the vertue in the mean: and the refore hee cares not in which extream hee can thruſt us, ſo as wee keep out of that mean appointed. Hee hateth nothing but vertue and grace, which God loveth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Hee knowing the propenſity and inclination of our corrupt nature (which deſires to know no mean, but is rather diſpoſed to any vice in extremity, than to reſt in obedience unto Gods Commandement) fits us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our inclination, and caſts us firſt in one extream, then in another, and holds us there where we beſt pleaſe our ſelves. Hence wee account ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames vertues.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Many are the by-waies that lead to hell on all hands, there being but one truth: and the Devil carrieth ſuch inceſſant malice to man, that hee cares not in which of them a man come to hell, ſo he come at length.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> Beware then of Satans ſubtlety, of his contrariety and extremities. In matters of Gods worſhip, his ſcope is to make a man either prophane, and caſt off all care of Religion; or if men will not bee drawn from ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, then hee ſeeks to make them ſuperſtitious, in which extream hee holdeth the blinded and devout Papiſts, who worſhip, both falſe gods, and the true God with a falſe and vain worſhip. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. the Apoſtle having charged the <hi>Athenians</hi> with ſuperſtition, hee addes this reaſon, becauſe hee <hi>ſaw an Altar to an unknown God.</hi> The ſame of thoſe, who will worſhip God in devices, which hee never commanded, and place it in things which indeed hinder it. And ſo ſome hate Popery, but not prophaneneſs. Satan aims al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at the Miniſter, to make him idle and negligent in preaching, and is well pleaſed with that; becauſe <hi>where viſion failes, people periſh.</hi> But if hee cannot hold a man in idleneſs, then hee ſeeks to get him to Preach, either of pride, or envy, or flattery, or for preferment, or vainly and unſoundly; and then the more hee preacheth, hee likes him never the worſe; or maliciouſly againſt good men, and good waies; and then hee preacheth nothing elſe but what Satan (if hee muſt needs preach) would do.</p>
                     <p>In hearing the word, hee would firſt have men ſlack of all conſcience of doing or obeying, that hearing their Maſters will, and not doing it, their ſtripes may bee the more. If hee cannot do that, but ſees a man make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his waies, then hee will make him ſcrupulous, and make needleſſe queſtions of every thing; and to hinder his peace, he will make more ſins than ever God made.</p>
                     <p>In judging of ones own eſtate, hee will make a man beleeve that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elected ſuch a wretch as hee, hee never had truth of grace, all is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, God never loved him; ſo many ſins, ſo great falls, ſuch unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as never was in any childe of God. On the contrary, if faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this temptation, then comes pride in ſtead of former dejection, and makes him think his election ſo ſure, as though hee take all unlawful liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hee ſhall bee ſaved; oh the Son of God cannot do amiſs, nor the Father hate him.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes to deſtroy boldneſs of faith hee will ſuggeſt, that ſin is ſo great in ſuch and ſuch circumſtances, as it cannot bee forgiven; now the heart is heavy and lumpiſh, and hath no cheerfulneſſe in God. But this being a little blown over, he wil bring the ſame man by degrees, to think what a fool he was; for his ſins now are not ſo great, ſo dangerous, as others bee, nor himſelf ſo great a ſinner: and now the ſadneſſe of ſin being ſhaken off, hee grows merry, and too too light, forgetting all his former heavineſs.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of life, hee gets beyond many in theſe extream courſes. In <hi>spiritual</hi> things, numbers of men are held in a prophane and wicked ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of religion, of Preachers, and Profeſſors, whoſe names they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide. Some of theſe are ſometimes called out of the ſnare of the Devil, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40284:71"/> then Satan is in a contrary corner, he will have them zealous, but not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge: If the Maſter will not ſend his ſervants to pluck up all the tares before harveſt, they will ſtand no longer in the field of the Church, but grow reſolute in ſchiſm and ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Civil</hi> things, how many examples of men have we extreamly covetous in their youth, but prodigal and voluptuous in extremity in their age; and ſo on the contrary, and in divers other inſtances?</p>

                     <p>Doct. <hi>Satan doth inceſſantly labour to draw men unto preſumption, and vain-glory, as here he did the Head.</hi> And this preſumption in a word, is nothing elſe but a vain confidence, that we are this or that, or can doe this or that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any word or ordinance of God. A vain hope, without warrant, is the very being of preſumption.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Iſrael</hi> went to warre againſt the Philiſtims, and were ſlain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four thouſand men: but they would make another on-ſet more warily, (as they thought) than before: they would ſend for the Ark from <hi>Shilo</hi> to ſave them; and when it came into the Hoſt, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> gave a ſhout, that the earth rang of it, preſuming that now they were ſafe enough: But all this was done of their own heads, and without warrant; and therefore God diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited them with an exceeding great ſlaughter of thirty thouſand foot-men; and the Ark (wherein they were ſo vainly confident) was taken, the Prieſts <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> ſlain, <hi>Eli</hi> breaks his neck, and ſuch a confuſion there was, that the Ark never came at <hi>Shilo</hi> more.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40284:72"/> him, who ſought the Lord with all his heart againſt an open Idolater; but not ſeeking the Lord in this, he was mortally wounded, and left his Kingdom in great trouble and confuſion, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.</p>

                        </label> Now Satan is moſt uſual in temptations to preſumption, for theſe reaſons. 1 He hath experience, how eaſily we are foyled with this kind of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how ſoon hee foyled our firſt Parents in the ſtate of innocency; how good <hi>David</hi> was overthrown, preſuming of his own ſtrength, when he forced <hi>Joab</hi> to number his people. And thoſe whom hee could never ſhake with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, he hath quite overthrown with preſumption.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Satan knows, that of all temptations, this is moſt agreeable to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature. It is pleaſing to us, to conceive of Gods mercy and power to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in any courſe our ſelves affect: whereas temptations to deſpair are irkſome, and grievous to the fleſh, and have not ordinarily ſo much help from the fleſh to ſet them forward as this hath; and therefore the Devil is ſometimes, but not half ſo often in them. Again, hee knows it goeth with our nature and ſtream, to preſume of our own goodneſs, ſtrength, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Diſciples, preſumed they ſhould not be offended at Chriſt, nor forſake, or deny him: but yet not long after, even they who profeſſed they would dye with him rather than deny him, leſt him, and fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.33, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 He knows, that preſumption is an extream of faith and hope, and doth no leſs extinguiſh faith, than deſpair, nay more often doth foyl it, ſeeing a man in deſpair is more fearful, more watchful, but a preſumptuous man is fearleſs, careleſs, and will eaſily thruſt himſelf upon any adventure, as fearing no ſin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Satan knows that preſumptions are <hi>great ſins, prevailing ſins,</hi> Pſal. 19.13. a tempting of the Lord (as the anſwer of our Saviour implies) when wee leave his way and means, and will try our own, a ſin which doth much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to diſpleaſure: we ſee it in <hi>Peter,</hi> who fell fearfully above all the Diſciples,

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What may we think of</hi> Jonathans <hi>action, who himſelf alone with one man his Armour-bearer, went out againſt a whole army of the Philiſtims? Was it not a ſtrange tempting of God, and a great diſorder in time of pitched battel?</hi> 1 Sam. 14.</p>

Beſides, he knew they were Gods enemies, ſaying, <hi>Let us goe to the uncircumciſed.</hi> 4 The event was a ſingular deliverance of God in that needful time: for God ſent a fear among the enemies, and an earth-quake, &amp;c. and armed <hi>Jonathan</hi> with ſuch a ſpirit and power, that the enemies fell before him for fear, even at the ſight of him.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. We muſt conceive all this doctrin of Chriſts temptations above an ordinary Hiſtory, not only relating a thing done, but belonging alſo to us to make our uſe of it, as of other Scripture. And hence let us learn to beware of theſe temptations to preſumption, which are many ways darted againſt us, both in things ſpiritual and temporal.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>In ſpiritual things:</hi> 1 When men caſt aſide the known Word of God, they dare ſwear, and curſe, and blaſpheme; they dare adventure to break the Sabbath, dare lye, and be unjuſt, againſt their conſcience; they dare doe any thing againſt the Juſtice of God, though they know his will to bee contrary: and all becauſe they preſume of Gods mercy, which in their conceit hath eaten up all his juſtice. But in <hi>Job.</hi> 19.11. Chriſt inlargeth the ſin of the Jews and <hi>Judas,</hi> becauſe it was againſt their conſcience, <hi>He that delivered me, hath the greater ſin:</hi> he was warned, he heard my Doctrin, ſaw my Miracles, and ſo did you. And thou that knoweſt thy Lords pleaſure, and dareſt goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, ſhalt know how fearful a thing it is to fall into his hands. It thy Conſcience condemn thee, God is greater than thy conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Others are perſwaded that Chriſt dyed for all, and therefore they may be the bolder in their ſins; grace hath abounded, what though ſin abound much more? Chriſt hath bloud enough, and merit enough, what need they fear? But here is preſumption without warrant. For in Chriſts death, before it can be fruitful to us, there muſt be two things, 1 An actual accompliſhment; 2 An effectual application to the ſoul in particular. Phyſick, though never ſo ſoveraign, if it be in the pocket unapplied, doth the Patient no good: And if the death of Chriſt be applied to thee, it worketh the death of thy ſin: Chriſt dyed to aboliſh ſin, and deſtroy the works of the Devil.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Many others are carried along in their preſumption, by a deceitful ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that they can come out of their ſin, and repent, when they liſt. But here is a vain hope without warrant, or elſe bring me a word that promiſeth repentance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o morrow, if this day thou neglect it; this is thy day, thou knoweſt not what the morrow may bring forth. Now thou haſt life, health, the world, miniſtery, and memory; perhaps this is the laſt day thou ſhalt enjoy all theſe. Oh, but I hope to repent: But ſhew thy warrant, elſe Satan hath thee in the bands of preſumption. Beſides, it is juſt with God, that hee who will not take Gods time, ſhould never come to his own. And dangerous it is to put our ſouls to adventure till the laſt hour.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Others feed a conceit, that howſoever God deal with others, he will not grow into ſuch diſpleaſure with them, they are further in his books than ſo; as Satan here intimates, that Gods Son may doe what hee liſt. But it is a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of wicked men, to make covenants with death, and ſecure themſelves, that when the ſword paſſeth through the Land, it ſhall not come near them, and to cry <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> when the trumpet hath ſounded warre. Again, tell me, thou that preſumeſt ſo farre to ſin, art thou further in Goods Books than <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, yea than the Angels in Heaven? Doeſt thou excel in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs thoſe Worthies of the world, <hi>Moſes, Aaron, David, Hezekiah?</hi> yet theſe could not eſcape when they ſinned. Shall the whole world (ſinning) be drowned, and ſhalt thou avoyd the deluge? No, no, the higheſt mountains in the world ſhall not ſave thee: nay, if thou couldſt climbe into Heaven, the Angels were caſt thence.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Others preſume of the end, and flie over the means; hope for ſalvation, but neglect the means, the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer. Oh, but they uſe means, they know God and their duty, as well as the beſt. But it is a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40284:73"/> knowledge; they think they need no more, they profeſs they know God, but in their works deny him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Yea, they beleeve all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Chriſtian Faith, if wee beleeve them; but it is a dead and vain faith, without works of Piety and Charity, ſuch as ſhall profeſs great acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God in the day of judgement, but to whom hee ſhall ſay, <hi>Depart from mee yee workers of iniquity.</hi> Yea, but they come to Church, and pray to God as others do, and hope to bee ſaved in their Religion what ever it is, ſo long as they mean well: and what need men bee ſo preciſe and curious? But theſe prayers are preſumptuous and abominable, if thou turn thine ear from hearing the Law: and ſo long as thou liveſt in thy luſts, and walkeſt not preciſely with God in all his Commandements, (though thou faſt, and pray, and afflict thy ſelf never ſo much) God will not hear, nor help. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never preſume of an harveſt without a ſeed time; as a man ſoweth, ſo ſhall hee reap.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Others (and a common preſumption it is) think themſelves in the high way to ſalvation; their names are written in the book of life, never to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out; they are beloved of God, and therefore they may do what they will, and leave undone what they liſt; they may injoy their pleaſure and liberty, their ſalvation dependeth not upon their works, but upon the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God that ſhews mercy. And thus out of a vain preſumption, they are idle and unfruitful in the work of the Lord, and ſometimes grow Libertines and ſcandalous, and ſtill God is the ſame (they ſay) and loves them. But what can bee a more evident note of Gods diſpleaſure, than to bee given up to ſuch a deluſion? as if the goodneſs of God would not lead his to repentance; or as if mercy were not with him to bee feared. But thou, out of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy heart which cannot repent, treaſureſt wrath againſt the day of wrath.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. In things of this life Satan prevailes exceedingly, with this temptation of preſumption.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 When men conclude of Gods love by temporal things, all which are common to good and bad. By which ſorcery, when they are moſt curſed, they think themſelves the happieſt men under the Sun. Whereas none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hatred</hi> by any thing before him; and as God beginneth his love at things within, faith, fear, uprightneſs of heart, and the like; ſo muſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the knowledge of it. And if wee compare <hi>Dives</hi> eſtate with <hi>Lazarus, Pharaohs</hi> with <hi>Moſes, Simon Magus</hi> with <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Money and gold have I none,</hi> wee ſhall eaſily ſee what little ground the Scripture affordeth for ſuch preſumptuous conceits.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Many of our great men venture to travel into places of idolatry, and think themſelves ſtrong enough againſt any ſuch temptations as they meet withall but, I were there zeal indeed, there would be alſo witneſs-bearing againſt ſuch horrible idolatry; whereas, if they do not act idolatry, they conſent to thoſe that do. Wee read of ſome noble and Heroical ſpirits, ſtirred up by the motion of God, to diſgrace and witneſs with their blood againſt that horrible Idol of the Maſſe. 2 It is a juſt judgement of God on many, who perhaps againſt their purpoſe, are catcht in the ſnare of Popery, and infected with the poyſon of their hereſies, becauſe they are given up to deluſion for want of juſt deteſtation of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Others are bold-hardy, to run into places infected with the plague with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a juſt warrant, or ſufficient calling, only pretending the ſtrength of their faith: which is temerity and raſhneſſe, often paid home with much ſorrow and bitterneſſe. Hath not God tyed his care over us, with our care over our ſelves? Hath not hee in ordinary courſe tyed our ſafety with the means? <hi>Act.</hi> 27. <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip, they cannot bee ſaved:</hi> and ſo ſome upon boards, and others upon planks, came ſafe to land. Yet I condemn not that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40284:73"/> preſence with infected perſons, which charity and conſcience requires: but in way of ordinary viſitation, it is as unſafe for us to go to them, as for them to come amongſt us, and a tempting of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Some are ſo bold-hardy, as to venture upon the dangerous places which are given by God to bee poſſeſſed of the Devil, and (as if they were Exorciſts) will adjure the Devil, and out-dare him: and this they think to bee ſtrength of faith. Which is indeed a folly, and extream preſumption, often repayed as it was in the ſons of <hi>Sceva, Act.</hi> 19.16. who undertaking to adjure the Devil (wanting a calling, commiſſion, and every thing but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption) were driven away, rent, and wounded. Others are of minde, they can never be bewitched, nor all the Devils in hell cannot touch them, their faith is ſo ſtrong. But that is a preſumption, ſeeing no man can abſolutely aſſure himſelf hee ſhall bee free from Satanical moleſtation. Chriſt could not bee free, whoſe faith is as ſtrong as thine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down:]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here bee in theſe words three things further to bee conſidered: 1 The action, which the Devil would effect, the <hi>caſting down</hi> of Chriſt. 2 The agent, not the Devil, but Chriſt himſelf muſt do it, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf.</hi> 3 <hi>Luke</hi> addes, <hi>from hence,</hi> where means of ſafety were.</p>
                     <p>Doct. 1 <hi>All the travel of the Devil, is to caſt down Chriſt, and in him all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</hi> The eſtate of the Church is militant while it is here below, and the battle is maintained between <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, and the Dragon and his Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7. and therefore as in a battel, the contrary part by all the power and policy it can, ſeeks to <hi>caſt down</hi> and overthrow, not the Captain onely, but all the adverſary power, and diſcomfit the whole Hoſt: ſo is it here.</p>
                     <p>To clear this point, wee muſt know there be three eſtates from whence Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath ever ſought to <hi>caſt</hi> men <hi>down.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 From the eſtate of innocency and grace created. <hi>Adam</hi> was no ſooner ſet up in this happy and glorious eſtate, but Satan <hi>caſt</hi> him <hi>down.</hi> And from this pinacle wee are all caſt down in him. The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf was ſundry waies aſſayld in theſe temptations, and ſundry others, to bee caſt down alſo from the ſame moſt innocent eſtate: which had been the caſting of us all, not out of the earthly Paradiſe with <hi>Adam,</hi> but a caſting down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto hell.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 From the eſtate of regeneration and grace renewed. Satans continual labour is, either to keep men under condemnation from the ſtate of grace, or to caſt them down (if it were poſſible) from that eſtate, to which they are by Chriſt reſtored. Hee worketh effectually in the ſons of diſobedience, by hardning their hearts, blinding their mindes, and leading them hood-winkt at his pleaſure to damnation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <hi>If our Gospel bee now hid, it is hid to them that periſh, in whom the God of the world hath blinded their mindes, that the light of the glorious Goſpel, which is the image of God, ſhould not ſhine unto them.</hi> And for the elect, hee ſets upon them falſe Prophets and ſeducers: hee is inceſſant in moſt malicious tentations, by which hee ſoileth them often in foul manner: and if hee cannot caſt them down from their eſtate in Chriſt, yet hee often caſteth them down from the comfort of it, both by inward and outward ſorrows and perſecutions. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. the Dragon, when hee cannot kill the woman, and her ſeed, hee will caſt out of his mouth waters like a floud to drown them: and if that prevail not, hee will ſtir up war with the remnant of the ſeed, which keep the Commandements of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 From the Pinacle of their outward eſtate or office, which they hold in the Church or Common-wealth: for ſo hee did here with Chriſt; when hee had gotten him to the Pinacle, hee thought to get him down eaſily: At
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40284:74"/> leaſt hee will do his beſt to caſt him down, for hee ſhould fall with wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> If hee ſee a man on the Pinacle of the Temple, a teacher in the Church, liſted up above others, in gifts or place, hee will leave no ſtone unturn'd to caſt him down: for hee knows, that (as if hee had here caſt down Chriſt, hee had caſt down with him all his members, ſo) if he can caſt down an eminent Teacher, hee caſts down with him as many as depend upon him. And here no Teacher can ſecure himſelf, if hee were in place above all the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the New Teſtament: nay, the higher the pinacle, the more ſlippery and dangerous to fall. <hi>Judas</hi> his place was an higher place than any ordinary miniſter of the New Teſtament ſtands upon: but yet how fearfully was hee caſt down by the Devil, who put it in his heart, and prevailed firſt for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of his Maſter, and then the hanging of himſelf? how did the Devill ſeek to winnow as wheat, the reſt of the Diſciples, that ſtood on the ſame battlements, who had as certainly been caſt down, but for the power and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their Maſter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31.</p>
                     <p>How ſtrongly may wee clear this truth, if wee obſerve one experience, which all the ages of the world have confirmed? namely, that the Devil hath ever ſtriven to ſet men on the Pinacle of the Temple, to caſt them down, and the Church in them. How hath hee by wicked means, as flattery, mony, and corruption, advanced them into the higheſt places and pinacles of the Church, whom hee might uſe as his chief Agents to ruinate and bane the Church? as the falſe Prophets in the Old Teſtament, that would ever with the Squirril build and have their holes open to the ſun-ſide, ever keep in with Princes, and ſing ſweetly to the preſent times; As alſo the falſe Apoſtles that would ſuffer nothing for Chriſt, but under a colour of preaching Chriſt, aboliſh Chriſt and his doctrin, taught and maintained by the true Apoſtles. How doth the Church complain, that ſhee was never ſo wounded as by the watch-men who alſo robbed her, and took away her veil from her? Look into the Records of fifteen hundred years and wee ſhall not read almoſt of any perſecutions of the Church, but raiſed and with all heat purſued by proud, perſecuting, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Biſhops, who kept the chief places in the Church. And ever ſince the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been by the Devil lifted up into the higheſt Pinacle of the Temple his caſting down and fall into ſo many monſters of doctrin and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, hath been in this Chriſtian World the ruine and downfal of ſo many as whoſe names are not written in the book of life. All this comes to paſs by the malice of the Devil, whoſe tayl draws the third part of the ſtars of Heaven, and caſteth them to the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.4.

For hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſets any on a Pinacle, but (as Chriſt here) to caſt him down. And then the Devil ſets the man on a Pinacle, when by wicked or baſe Arts, a man riſeth to wealth, or honour, or any publick place in the Church or Common-wealth: he will willingly lend his help and hand, thus to exalt and ſet up men, but as the Hang-man helps the Thief up the Ladder, to turn him off with a break-neck. <hi>Haman</hi> was advanced to great honour; but was it not to his greater ruine and downfall? Did not he help up <hi>Herod</hi> by pride and ambition, almoſt above the Pinacle? when he ſpake, <hi>Oh, it was the voyce of God, and not of a man.</hi> But was it not to caſt him down lower than all his people, to bee preſently eaten with Lice. He ſends up <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to the pinacle of his Palace, and that was great <hi>Babel</hi> which hee had built for the honour (not of God, but) of his Kingdom; and by the might (not of God, but) of his own power.

Beſides, he ſpecially intendeth to bring Chriſt to the ſin of preſumption, in throwing himſelf down, which he could not effect by his caſting him down, unleſs himſelf (bearing himſelf upon his Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection) can be brought to caſt himſelf down. 3 Although afterward Satan had power by his inſtruments to put our Saviour Chriſt to death, yet now he could not by caſting him down the pinacles doe it, no more than the people could, when they attempted to caſt him down the hill: for his hour was not yet come, he had not yet done that great work, which he came into the world to doe, and the hour for the power of darkneſs was not yet.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not denyed, but that ſomething beſides God, can move the will: but the Queſtion is, of the manner. God moves it by his own and abſolute power, even without our ſelves, and againſt our ſelves, as when hee changeth an heart of ſtone into an heart of fleſh. But others without us cannot move our hearts, neither by any proper power that they have over them, nor yet without our ſelves firſt gained unto them; but then they move our wills, when they can either make us apprehend and underſtand ſome Object, or move paſſion or appetite, whereby to incline our wills. Thus the good Angels may and do propound divine truth and good unto our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and move our wills to imbrace it and chooſe it, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with effect, becauſe the power is not in them, but in our ſelves.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his will to it, having firſt raiſed a cloud of duſty paſſion to darken his underſtanding: and the other <hi>Saul</hi> in his fury and hot mood to waſte and perſecute all that called on Chriſt: <hi>ſometimes</hi> by ſtirring up luſt and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence; as <hi>David</hi> being inflamed with luſt, the Devil working on this corruption, gained his will to thoſe foul facts, which above all blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
                     <p>As for the examples alleadged; thus <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Satan filled</hi> Ananiahs <hi>heart;</hi> not that hee brought any new wickedneſs into his heart, but, that which hee found hee ſtirred up, and perſwaded his will to play that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling part, for hee ſhould carry it away cloſely and cautelouſly enough. And thus the Devil put treaſon into the heart of <hi>Judas:</hi> hee knew him to bee a Covetous wretch; and had often watched him how hee was deceitful in the adminiſtration of his Maſters money: now his affection being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and ſtuft with Covetouſneſs, Satan uſeth this as a means to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his will for mony to attempt this ſoul and barbarous treaſon.</p>
                     <p>In all which wee ſee, that our wills are not under the power of the Devil, who deals with us as wicked men, who when they perſwade any evil, infuſe none of their wickedneſs into us, but only by their ſpeech ſtir up that which is in our ſelves, and perſwade us thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It is not enough for Satans malice and cruelty to bring miſchief on the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40284:76"/> bodies of men, but the thing hee aims at is, to bring guiltineſs on their ſouls: as our Saviour here, I doubt not but hee would willingly have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, if it had been in his power to caſt him down, as it was to carry him up: but hee had far rather that Chriſt ſhould do it himſelf, and ſo have an hand in his own death. In <hi>Job,</hi> Satan was not contented to caſt him down, in bringing miſery upon his body and eſtate, but the thing hee aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſting down himſelf by blaſpheming God, that ſo hee might bring guiltineſs upon his ſoul. And Satan knows, that when hee can bring a ſinner to give up his will to his perſwaſion, his ſin is ſo much the more ſinful, becauſe to a voluntary ſin is added, 1 A deliberation. 2 An election of evil, and a preferring it before good: and 3 A willing execution of that which a corrupt underſtanding hath embraced, and a corrupt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and will preferred for ſome corrupt end.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Satans ſlineſs and uſual ſubtlety in his temptations, ſhews that his ſtrength lyeth in inward perſwaſion, and not in outward violence: Hee inſinuates like a Serpent, and pretends great good will, as hee, Thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelf the Son of God; as though hee in earneſt ſought the honour of Chriſt: and, as if hee would have bettered <hi>Adams</hi> eſtate, hee ſaid, <hi>Yee ſhall bee gods.</hi> He transforms himſelf into an Angel of light, and ordinarily deals with us as with <hi>Saul,</hi> who, when hee ſaw the Devil himſelf, hee made him beleeve hee ſaw <hi>Samuel,</hi> Gods worthy Prophet.</p>

Were it not too too baſe a dejecting of himſelf, if a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man ſhould ſort himſelf to lye in a Barn among beggars; or any man to lye in a ſtye among ſwine? So for a Chriſtian to demean himſelf like a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or Epicure, or Atheiſt, is as great a debaſement. Others caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down into the pit of deſpair, when any ſorrow or trouble extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſſeth or pincheth them.

As Chriſt was not ſet on a pinacle, which had no ſtairs to go down by, but where were ſtairs: and hee muſt notwithſtanding them, caſt himſelf down head-long. So dealt hee with <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, who having all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40284:77"/> perfections his ſoul and body were capable of, yet muſt he needs reach at the bettering of his eſtate: had <hi>Adam</hi> known any miſery yet, his ſin had been ſo much the leſs, if he had been enticed unwarrantably to mend his eſtate; but he did (as the Parable ſpeaks) ſet an old patch upon a new garment, which was both idle and diſgraceful. And the means of his ſin, was as idle as the end: for, had he not all the Trees of the Garden, and fruits of Paradiſe to eat upon? and were not all elſe means enough to keep him from one forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit? If God had reſtrained all but one, he had not wronged him: hee had furniſhed him with all ſtrength againſt temptation, if he would have uſed it: he had no manner of diſcontent in his eſtate: yet if he had been overcome in that ſuppoſal, to have enlarged without God his own allowance, his ſin had not been in that degree, and ſo out of meaſure ſinful, as the having of all theſe means made it. Who muſt deny our Saviour Chriſt, but one of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples? who muſt betray him but another? both of them abounding with means to the contrary, having been advanced by Chriſt into the high Offices of Apoſtleſhip, to be next attendants of Chriſt, who heard his Doctrin, ſaw his Miracles, and were eye-witneſſes of the integrity of his life, yea both ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially warned by Chriſt of thoſe particular ſins, and <hi>Peter</hi> had profeſſed to dye rather than doe it.</p>

                     <p>Hence it was alſo, that our Lord anſwering <hi>Pilate,</hi> aggravated the ſin of <hi>Judas</hi> Joh. 19.11. <hi>He that delivered me unto thee, hath the greater ſin:</hi> hee knew he delivered an innocent to death, he was warned, he was a friend and familiar, his ſin was a great ſin: and ſo great as God took him in hand, and laid the burden of it preſently upon his ſoul, and hee found no eaſe but in hanging himſelf.</p>

                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:40284:78"/>2 Satan knows theſe ſins more trouble and wound the Conſcience than other, becauſe this circumſtance lays the ſin directly upon our ſelves, and takes away excuſes; God was not wanting to prevent ſuch; a man cannot ſay he could not remedy it, no good means was wanting to him, only hee was wanting to himſelf and the means. And thus the Lord reaſoneth with his people to bring them to the ſight of their own corruption, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4. <hi>What could I doe more to my vineyard which I have not done?</hi>

                     <p n="3">3 Satan knows, that to ſin againſt means is a compound ſin, and like to a complicated diſeaſe, hardly cured: for beſides the ſin, to which a man is drawn, there is, 1 A neglect of a mans own good: 2 There is a baſe eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Gods great kindneſs in offering the means of our good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, God himſelf is deſpiſed in the means; yea, there is an unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rejecting of grace offered.

                     <p n="4">4 Well knows Satan, that God hath denounced and executed greater plagues upon theſe ſins than other, where means were not preſent. He puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Adultery in the Law with death, not ſimple fornication, becauſe one had means to avoyd the ſin, the other wanted it. So for Theft, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.30. If a Thief ſteal to ſatisfie his ſoul, becauſe he is hungry, men deſpiſe him not; a reſtitution may be made, he muſt not dye; comparing the ſin with adultery, in which no reſtitution muſt bee made, they muſt dye the death. <hi>Capernaum,</hi> which was lifted up to heaven in reſpect of the means of Salvation, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thoſe ſtairs, caſt her ſelf lower into hell than 7 <hi>yrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> which never had the like things done in them.

How may the Lord complain of us, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.10. <hi>I have written to them the great things of my Law, but they have counted it a vain thing?</hi> The means that we have, doe ſet our ſins in a farre higher degree than were the ſins of our fathers. Theirs were in the night, ours in the day; theirs were ignorances in compariſon, ours are preſumptions, of knowledge and ſet purpoſe: theirs were errors and ſins, ours are rebellions and obſtinacy: they could ſcarce doe any other, we will not: their ignorance invincible, ours affected. And as our means be greater, ſo our judgement and account ſhall be ſtraighter: for, to whom <hi>God gives more, of them hee requires more,</hi> Luke 12.48.</p>

Conſider whether the Scripture be not true, ſaying, 1 Not the hearers of the Word, but the doers thereof ſhall be juſtified. 2 Knowers of their Maſters will, and not doers of it, ſhall be beaten with more ſtripes. 3 Many ſeem to be partakers of grace, who are perverters of it, and turn it into wantonneſs, who are of old rolled or billed unto condemnation. 4 Many in the day of Judgement ſhall ſay and alleadge for themſelves, Wee have eat and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets; to whom the judge ſhall ſay, <hi>I tell you, I know not whence you are: depart from mee yee workers of iniquity.</hi>

And the ſame ſhall be ſaid of every formal Chriſtian, contenting himſelf with an outward ſhew of goodneſs, and not anſwerable to the means he hath, without any inward, or conſtant change by them.</p>

                     <p n="1">I <hi>In ſpiritual things,</hi> the means of ſalvation are ſtairs to Heaven: 1 If thou beeſt not a member of the Church, and abideſt in the ſhip, thou canſt not be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.31. 2 If being over-run with the diſeaſe of ſin, thou waiteſt not at the Pool wherein and when the Spirit moveth and ſtirreth the waters, thou canſt not be cured, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. Refuſe the Word and Sacraments, thou periſheſt. 3 If God have ſhewed thee, oh man, what is good, and what he requireth of thee, ſurely to doe juſtly, to love mercy, to humble thy ſelf, and walk with thy God: if thou caſt thy ſelf off theſe ſtairs into injuſtice, unmercifulneſs, pride, and profaneneſs, by this fall thou doeſt break the neck of thy ſoul. So when the Lord affords many gracious means within a man and without: <hi>without,</hi> the exhortations and precepts of his Word, and the warnings of his correcting hand; then, 1 <hi>Suffer the word of exhortation gladly,</hi> let the word rule thee, ſin not againſt the word by which thou art to be judged. 2 Let the rod open the ear that was ſealed, and correction bee thy inſtruction: it is a note of bleſſedneſs to bee chaſtened, and taught in Gods Law. The Lord is glad to adde this means to let in the former; and if men ſtill fall back more and more, the Lord caſts ſuch perſons off.</p>
                     <p>So when he <hi>inwardly</hi> uſeth either checks of Conſcience, or elſe the motions of his Spirit, ſin not againſt them: for, 1 The voyce of thy Conſcience muſt thou hear one day, therefore ſuffer it not to goe on in accuſing thee, but ſtill it by caſting out the core of ſin, that makes it ſo reſtleſs and painful. 2 Quench not the motions of Gods Spirit: for this grieves him, and makes him goe away in diſpleaſure, and then all thy ſound comfort is gone with him.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>In temporal things,</hi> ſin not againſt the means. He muſt eat that muſt live, he muſt work that will eat, ſow to reap; he that would avoyd a ſtrange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, muſt love his own wife; all the Souldiers and people in the Ship muſt come ſafe to land, but then muſt they not caſt them into the ſea, but abide in the ſhip. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.33. the Prophet in the Lords name tells <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi> ſhall not enter into the City; but if hereupon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſhould have bid them ſet the gates open, would not the Prophet have told him he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the City? For a rich man to be an Uſurer, or an oppreſſor, is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin than it is taken for, becauſe it is againſt the means: yet who are Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers elſe? who oppreſſors elſe? who grinde the faces of the poor, who detain the wages of poor Servants, but they? For a man to break the Sabbath for gain is a great ſin, as appeareth in the poor man that went out to gather ſticks: but how great then is it in rich men who need not, having much means beyond the preſent neceſſity? and yet they, or their Servants and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, muſt be gathering ſticks to burn themſelves withall in Hell.

Satan is too black here, and lales his ſnare in vain before the eye of that which hath wing. But to hide his blackneſſe, hee draws a fair glove over a ſoul hand, and aſſaies to make the caſe without all danger or abſurdity: Hee hath that to ſay which the Son of God cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe: Hee hath Scripture to perſwade him; for no reaſon is comparable to this, to aſſure the Son of God who muſt hear the word of his Father, that there is neither danger, nor unreaſonableneſs in this motion; nay, there is much good in it: 1 Hee ſhall ſhew himſelf to bee the Son of God: 2 Hee ſhall ſhew his affiance in his Fathers word, which hath fully aſſured him of his Fathers protection: as if hee ſhould ſay, Thou being the Son of God, mayeſt without danger caſt thy ſelf down hence; but do not take it on my word, which perhaps thou mayeſt ſuſpect, but take it on thy Fathers word: If that hath any truth in it, there is no danger in my motion: And becauſe thou ſhalt not think that I ſpeak without book, <hi>It is written</hi> in thy Fathers Book; If I had a Pſalter here I could ſhew it thee, that hee hath given his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee, that thou daſh not thy foot againſt a ſtone: and though thou caſt thy ſelf down, they ſhall bear thee up, and ſave thee harmleſs. And if they ſhould fail of their duty, thou being the Sonne of God, canſt ſuſtain thy ſelf by thine own proper power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>

                     <p>This is <hi>Moſes</hi> his rule, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1.

If a doctrin or ſcripture be alledged to nouriſh any fleſhly delight, or to hold men in ſin, though the words bee Gods, the allegation is the Devils: as, <hi>At what time ſoever a ſinner repenteth,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>the Theef was ſaved at the laſt hour;</hi> and therefore, if thou canſt ſay two or three good words at thy death, all ſhall bee well: here is the Devil, ſaying, <hi>It is written:</hi> for all ſcripture truely cited by Gods Spirit aims at mortification, and the furtherance of Repentance.

This teacheth us not to content our ſelves to know the Scripture, and bee able to ſpeak of it, or to alledge it: for the Devil knows the word, and can alledge it readily, yea, hee is expert in it. Many men deceive themſelves in their eſtate, and think themſelves ſure of ſalvation, if they can get a lirtle knowledge of the ſcripture above others: as though Satan could not alledge it, or as though the wicked could not preach it, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, or ungodly men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, who <hi>take the word into their mouth, and hate to bee reformed,</hi> Pſal. 50.16, 17.</p>

                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. But let us take heed wee come not behind the Devil himſelf, while wee thus highly conceit our ſelves: for, 1 Are there not a number of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men, almoſt as ignorant as if the ſcriptures had never been written? and ſhall not the Devil condemn theſe, who hath gained ſo much knowledge in the word, which containeth not one word of comfort for him, but judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that makes him tremble? Yet theſe, whom they would make wiſe to ſalvation, and to whom they offer the joyes and comfort of life eternal, are utterly ignorant of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Many read the Scripture, but as Satan, not to inform or reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor to make themſelves better, but both themſelves and others far worſe, as not only Hereticks and learned Papiſts, who bend all their knowledge to ſuppreſs and hide the truth, but all ſuch as by the ſcripture ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So as by this ſtratagem Satan uſurps the conſcience, which is Gods right, and ſo leads men at his pleaſure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 His malice ſets him clean contrary to God in his proceedings. God hath given his Scripture to ſave men by, and therefore it is called, a <hi>word of ſalvation:</hi> now Satan would herein croſs the Lord, in perverting the word to mens condemnation. The Scripture is in the Church as a Law to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to contain men in the compaſs of faith and godly life; whence it is called <hi>Statutes,</hi> and <hi>precepts,</hi> and <hi>judgements.</hi> But Satan ſeeks to enforce it as a Law to thruſt men from faith and obedience. The Scripture is a word of truth, of holineſs, of wiſdom, every way reſembling God the Author: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40284:81"/> therefore, being the greateſt enemy to Gods Image, is the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Scriptures, and deſireth to pervert them, by eſtabliſhing by them Errours, Hereſies, falſe Doctrins, wicked and fooliſh opinions and practices.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 His ſubtilty and policy is not inferiour to his malice: for, 1 He hath a ſpecial ſlight and trick of his own, by pretending truth to impugn it, and with Scripture to fight againſt Scripture; which hee hath taught his ſpecial Factors, Hereticks, and Seducers: for why elſe did Chriſt forbid the Devil to witneſs to him, but that even that truth he ſpeaks, ever tends to deſtroy the truth? And in the text, why cites he the truth, but to draw Chriſt into an error? 2 He will gain to himſelf ſome credit by this practice: for ſeeing ſpeeches and teſtimonies depend much upon the credit of the ſpeaker, by his quoting of Scripture he would be taken, as if the truth of Scripture depended upon, or needed his witneſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Satan muſt doe thus, if hee will prevail againſt Chriſt, or his Servants: for Scripture in the true ſenſe of it, is no patron of ſin, nor ever ſtands on the Devils ſide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe.</hi> Of all temptations beware moſt of them which come armed with Scripture: for hardlier can wee eſpy the ſubtilty and danger of theſe, than thoſe which are directly againſt the Scripture. And by temptations of this kind, Satan mightily prevaileth in points both of doctrin and practice; which it ſhall not be amiſs to give ſome taſte of, and in both wee ſhall obſerve how Satan doth not ſo much uſe as abuſe Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. In matters of doctrin. 1 For the eſtabliſhing of the Head-ſhip of the Church in the Pope, the ordinary Papiſts have found a Scripture in <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.16. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Feed my ſheep.</hi> I anſwer: Firſt, that place ſpeaks not of any Head-ſhip, or Spiritual government, but of feeding by the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the Pope never doth: Secondly, it is a commandement not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but to all the Apoſtles, who were equally Apoſtles with him, but applied to <hi>Peter</hi> ſpecially, not to note any Primacy, but ſecretly to check him for his three-fold denial, whereby he made himſelf unworthy to be a Diſciple.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But</hi> Peter <hi>ſaith he hath two ſwords, and therefore the Pope hath both Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal juriſdiction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> This is a place of Satans alleadging, when that which is ſpoken lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, is wreſted into a figurative ſenſe. And where <hi>Peter</hi> is commanded (<hi>Act.</hi> 10.13.) <hi>to kill, and eat,</hi> the Pope may kill, and ſlay, and eat up whom he will or can, Prince with people. But this is a place literally to be taken, and one part of the argument hangs with another as the dream of a ſick man: for the Pope, if he be <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, muſt feed the ſheep, nor feed on them. But <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who would make the world beleeve his wit is thinner, hath devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a farre more ſufficient place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Behold, I put in Sion a chief corner ſtone, elect and precious;</hi> that is, the Pope: In his Preface to the Controverſie, <hi>De Rom. Pontif.</hi> and <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. But what may wee think to reap from him, that dares begin his Controverſie with ſo high a blaſphemy? and leſt wee ſhould think it fell inconſiderately from him, he takes it up again. For doth not both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> teach, that this ſtone can be meant of none but of Chriſt? doth not both of them adde, <hi>He that beleeveth in him, ſhall not bee aſhamed?</hi> muſt we now beleeve in the Pope? And who is this living ſtone that gives life to all that are built upon him, beſides Chriſt himſelf? None can arrogate it to himſelf, or attribute it to another without high blaſphemy. Therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, boldly affirming that the Devil could not more impiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe this place, than hath blaſphemous <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 For the point of Juſtification by Works, is alleadged that place of <hi>James,</hi> 2.21. wherein they adde unto the text, 1 A falſe gloſs, <hi>by works of the Law.</hi>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:40284:82"/> 2 A falſe diſtinction, ſaying, that they juſtify as cauſes; whereas we grant that as effects they juſtify, that is, declare a man to bee juſtified: So did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> works declare him to be juſt: and this is not the juſtification of the perſon, which is onely by faith, but of the faith of the perſon, which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly dead without them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 In that great ſacramentary controverſy they alledge, <hi>This is my body:</hi> wherein Satan hath taught them to abuſe Scripture, in taking that literally which is figuratively ſpoken, as often to writhe that into a figure which is ſpoken literally: and whereas they exclaim againſt us for denying the words of Chriſt, as Hereticks, wee are far from denying Chriſts words, but diſclaim their falſe meaning, which deſtroies the Scripture, ſeeing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtands not in words, but in ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 To eſtabliſh the falſe Doctrin of Free-will, they furniſh themſelves with that place in <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is.</hi> But what do they elſe but imitate the Devil, in cutting off that part of the Text which makes againſt them? for in the next verſe it followeth, <hi>The heart of man is deceitful above all things, who can know it?</hi> ſhewing, that man in himſelf is utterly deſtitute of all grace.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 For the Jeſuitical trick of equivocation, or mental reſervation, they have Scripture and Example.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.21. they asked <hi>John</hi> if hee were a Prophet, hee ſaid, <hi>No,</hi> whereas he was one: for <hi>Zachary</hi> called him the Prophet of the Higheſt, and Chriſt ſaid that there was not a greater Prophet than <hi>John:</hi> therefore <hi>John</hi> equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whatſoever was the true meaning of the Queſtion, that <hi>John</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered plainly unto. If they meant to ask him if hee were <hi>that</hi> ſingular Prophet, whom they fancied to come together with their Meſſiah, hee truely anſwered, No. If hee were any of the ancient Prophets, who were long before Chriſt, hee truely anſwered in that ſenſe, No. If hee were a Prophet by his proper office, hee truely anſwered, no. For howſoever he was by grace and power a Prophet, being ſent of God to reprove and convert ſinners; yet by ordinary office, hee was no Prophet, neither did he prophecy.</p>
                     <p>But what is this to thoſe mental reſervations; Are you a Prieſt, <hi>Garnet?</hi> No, ſaith hee, meaning not a Prieſt of <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Were not you in <hi>England</hi> at ſuch a time? No, not as the Sun in the firmament, or as a King in a Kingdome. A ſtrange madneſs, that men profeſſing knowledge and zeal, ſhould ſo dally with lies and oaths: which tricks of theirs, were they juſtifiable and ſound, wee ſhould have little uſe of Magiſtracy or tribunals, eſpeciall where matters are determined by mens oathes: hee were a very block that would ſuffer any thing to bee faſtened upon him. The murderer might ſwear hee never ſlew man, namely, with the jaw-bone of an Aſs as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did. The Drunkard might ſwear hee drunk never a drop, if hee can inwardly conceive of water, or <hi>aqua coeleſtis,</hi> or the Poets nectar, or what hee can feign. The Adultreſs might ſwear ſhee was never toucht, if ſhee can inwardly conceive of any creature, as of a Bull, or a Swan, as the Poets feign of <hi>Paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> and <hi>Lada.</hi> And were it lawful to dally with God, and mens Conſciences, after this manner, wee could pay them home in their own kinde: for ſuppoſe a man were in their Inquiſion, and were asked if the Pope were Supream over all Kings; if a man were diſpoſed to equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, hee might ſay and ſwear, yea; reſerving his ſecret meaning, not by right, but onely in his own proud and ambitious deſire; and thus delude them.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. In matters of practice, you ſhall have no ſinner but he hath a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reached to him, to lye ſafe under in the holding of his ſin, but robbed and turned out of the right ſenſe. The Atheiſt, that cares for no Scripture,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40284:82"/> yet hath one text for himſelf, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Bee not juſt overmuch, nor overwiſe:</hi> and ſo hee hath enough to caſt off all care of knowledge, and conſcience. The Image-munget hath a Text, to let <hi>nothing bee lost:</hi> hee hath a good uſe for his Images; if they cannot ſerve to worſhip, they may ſerve for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament. The Swearer hath a Text in <hi>Jeremy, Thou ſhalt ſwear in truth, righteouſneſſe, and judgement:</hi> therefore hee will ſwear ſo long as hee ſweareth nothing but that which is true. The Sabbath-breaker hath his Text, <hi>The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</hi> The Murderer and Adulterer think themſelves ſafe, ſeeing they finde <hi>David</hi> in both theſe ſins, and yet commended of God. The Drunkard hath his leſſon, <hi>Drink no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger water, but a little wine for thy ſtomack, and often infirmities ſake.</hi> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous perſon knows, that hee <hi>that provides not for his family, is worſe than an Infidel,</hi> which through many mens wickedneſſe, is a ground of much covetouſneſſe. The lazy Proteſtant hath his Text, <hi>Wee are ſaved by grace, and juſtified by the blood of Chriſt freely:</hi> what can his works do? what need they? The idle perſon hath his Text, <hi>Care not for to morrow, let to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row care for it ſelf.</hi> The Uſurer hath his plain place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.27.—<hi>That I might have received mine own with Uſury.</hi> The Theef, hath the Theef on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> repenting at the laſt. The carnal Goſpeller cares not what ſin he venture on, <hi>becauſe where ſin hath abounded, there grace hath abounded much more.</hi> The careleſs <hi>Libertine</hi> is predeſtinated to life or death, do what hee can, and do what hee liſt, hee cannot change Gods Decree: and ſo he will do what hee liſt. The obdurate and hardned ſinner ſaith, <hi>At what time ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a ſinner repents, God will put all his ſins out of his remembrance,</hi> and therefore hee will not repent till hee bee dying.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the unjuſt perſon hee hath his rule in the unjuſt Steward, who was commended by Chriſt: who was indeed commended for his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not for his injuſtice. In all theſe thou mayeſt hold this for a good rule, <hi>It is the Devils divinity, to confirm thy ſelf in any ſin by whatſoever thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or readeſt in Gods book;</hi> all which in Gods meaning is direct, and the only preſervative againſt all ſin.</p>
                     <p>NOw wee are to conſider this comfortable Scripture in the holy uſe of it, not as wee have it wreſted and mangled by Satan, but as wee find it ſet down by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.11. <hi>For hee ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy waies: They ſhall bear thee in their hands, that thou hurt not thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which words the godly are ſecured, and aſſured of ſafety in danger, not onely becauſe the Lord himſelf is become their refuge and protection, as in the words going before, but in that to his own fatherly care and providence hee hath added a guard of Angels: to whoſe care alſo hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Godly. Wherein for explication, wee will note theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 What is the miniſtery of the Angels, namely, to bee the godly mans keepers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Who ſealeth their Commiſſion, <hi>He</hi> hath given them charge.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The limitation of it, <hi>In all thy waies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 The manner, <hi>They ſhall bear thee up in their hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5 The end, <hi>leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> Which is a borrowed ſpeech taken from Mothers or Nurſes, who lead or carry their tender children in their hands, that they ſtumble and fall not to hurt or endanger them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Angel,</hi> is a name not of nature (for ſo they bee ſpirits) but of office, <hi>miniſtring spirits,</hi> to God, to Jeſus Chriſt, and to Gods Elect <hi>His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>] that is, the good and Elect Angels, called <hi>his,</hi> 1 By Creation: for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40284:83"/> they had not being of themſelves. 2 By more immediate miniſtery, they aſſiſt him, and ſtand before his face; whereas the wicked Angels are caſt down from Heaven, from enjoying his preſence. 3 By grace of perſeverance: for they fell not from their eſtate, as the wicked Angels did, and are now confirmed by Chriſt that they cannot fall: and hence is <hi>Chriſt called the Head of men and Angels, in whom all things in heaven and earth conſiſt, Coloſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 17. that is, are preſerved, ſuſtained, and governed, whether viſible or inviſible; and conſequently a mediator of the Angels in reſpect of ſpecial grace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, by which they inſeparably adhere to God, although in reſpect of that mediation which is reſtrained to redemption, the Angels have no need of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Charge]</hi> This charge is not a general Commandement over the Church in general, but a ſpecial charge over every godly man, over <hi>thee.</hi> And the charge is directed to many Angels to keep one man; for the word affords us more comfort, than that Popiſh and ungrounded conceit, of every mans having his particular Angel.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Why doth God give this charge to the Angels? or why doth he uſe their Miniſtery?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not for any neceſſity (for hee by his word and beck doth ſuſtain Heaven and Earth, and without them can keep his own) but out of his good will to us, hee declares his love and care of us, who hath ſo abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for our ſafety, and made far more glorious natures than our ſelves our keepers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To keep thee]</hi> This cuſtody of the Angels ſtandeth. 1 In obſerving and watching their perſons, ſouls, bodies, and eſtates, and therefore are called <hi>watchmen,</hi> Dan. 4.10. <hi>And I ſaw a watchman, and an holy one come down from Heaven.</hi> 2 In propulſing and averting evil: ſo here, <hi>There ſhall no evill come near thee, for hee will give his Angels charge over thee.</hi> 3 In defending them in good, as <hi>Elizeus</hi> and his ſervant being compaſſed with enemies. 4 In comforting them in trouble, as <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 21.17. and <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.1, 2. and Chriſt in this place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In all thy waies]</hi> Namely, in ſuch courſes as God hath appointed, and in <hi>all</hi> theſe, in all times, and in all places, in all eſtates and conditions. In the way into the world, in birth, and infancy, the good Angels keep Gods lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. In the way thorow the world they keep us, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.2. In the way out of the World, their charge is to keep us, as wee may ſee in <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who when hee dyed the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels carried his ſoul into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. In <hi>all</hi> our waies, by day and by night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they keep us ſo long as wee are in our callings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They ſhall bear thee in their hands]</hi> This is a borrowed ſpeech: for Angels have no hands, nor bodies: ſometimes they aſſume bodies in their miniſtery to others, but theſe bodies are not theirs, neither were they naturally and hypoſtatically united unto them, but for the time created and aſſumed: but, from what beginning they were taken, or into what end after the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they were reſolved, it is idle to inquire. Here hands are aſcribed to them, as elſewhere wings, both improperly; one ſhews the ſpeedineſs of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the other their fitneſs and tenderneſs in our keeping: For their charge is not onely to foreſee danger and admoniſh us, but they muſt bee actual helpers, to bear us up from ground, when wee are ready to fall, and get knocks; as a tender mother or nurſe, if they ſee the little child falling, will haſte and catch it before the head comes to the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That thou daſh not thy foot againſt a ſtone.]</hi> That is, that thou hurt not thy foot againſt any rub or occaſion. Angels are nurſes, wee are as infants in ſpiritual matters, on every occaſion ready to fall into ſin, and by it into all dangers, ſpiritual and temporal. Now the Angels keep us not onely from
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40284:83"/> hurt by others, but from bringing hurt on our ſelves, even the leaſt; they keep us from hurting our Head, yea our Foot.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But how do the Angels perform their charge, when ſome of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren not onely ſtumble, but fall spiritually, and bodily, and take great harm?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe no man keeps his way ſo diligently and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly as hee ought. If wee did never fail, God would never fail us, no more would his holy Angels; nay, ſuch is their love, as they would not have us to take the leaſt hurt in the world, while wee walk faithfully in the waies and commandements of God.</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>The Angels of God are the tender keepers of Gods children in Gods waies, that no hurt can beside them. Gen.</hi> 32.5. When <hi>Jacob</hi> was in great fear of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> the Angel of God met him to comfort and defend him. When <hi>Sodome</hi> was to bee deſtroyed; the Angels came to <hi>Lot</hi> to forewarn and haſte him out of that wicked City. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord pitcheth his tents round about them that fear the Lord,</hi> and delivereth them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Becauſe of Jeſus Chriſt our Head, <label type="milestone">

In our ſelves and our own vileneſs wee could not bee indured by theſe bleſſed ſpirits, but now Chriſt becomes our head, and for him they tend us as his members.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Their love to us is another ground of their cuſtody of us, manifeſted in that they are compared to Nurſes: neither can they but love thoſe whom they ſee God loveth; now they ſee God loving us ſo dearly, that hee ſpares not his own Son, but gives him to the death for us, and therefore they dearly love us and our good, they deſire our ſalvation and promote it, they rejoyce that our ſalvation is wrought, and are glad of our repentance, by which wee lay hold on it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 And ſpecially this charge and commandement of God is the cauſe hereof; ſo as now it is not out of curteſy, or the goodneſs of their nature on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they do us good, but by vertue of this charge and commandement of God, whom they love as their chief good, and to whom they are bound in abſolute obedience by the eternal law of their nature; ſo as although they are charged by God, yet are they not forced or co-acted, but out of their perfect love of God they watch over us for our good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This doctrin affords a uſe of great conſolation: for when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our own weakneſs and impotency on one hand, and the multitude, power, and policy of our enemies on the other, when wee ſee a whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of ſins beſiedging us, and a whole legion of dangers behinde them to oppreſſe and ſwallow us; now this Doctrin touching Gods providence in the miniſtery of Angels, will be able to ſupport us; when wee ſhall conſider, not only that Gods protection is as a wall of fire round about us, but that he hath ſet and pirched his Angels round about us as a guard, of whom we may ſay with <hi>Eliſha</hi> for their multitude, <hi>They are more that are with us,</hi>

                     <p>And when wee ſhall conſider, that God hath given a charge, and that not to one or two Angels, but to the whole bleſſed company of them over every godly man, how can wee but aſſure our ſelves, that wee ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and protected? If a man were to paſs by ſhip over a dangerous ſea, full of gulfs, ſands, rocks, and robbers, if the King ſhould give him letters of ſafe conduct, it would much comfort him and help him through his voyage: but, if this King ſhould ſend a great Navy to conduct him over, yea, and ſhould not onely go in his own perſon, but call out all his men of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40284:84"/> war to ſee him ſafely arrived, this were ſo comfortable as hee could not wiſh more. But thus doth the Lord with his children, not onely himſelf going with them through the world, but guarding them with his holy Angels, who willingly afford their miniſtery, becauſe of their love to man, but in reſpect of Gods word and charge much more willingly, that of Gods Angels they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10.</p>
                     <p>What an unſpeakeable comfort is it, that when wee loſe the watch over our ſelves many waies, through ſleep of ſoul or body, the Angels watch over our ſafety? <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a ſleep, and thought not of that danger which was even upon him, by means of <hi>Herods</hi> cruelty: but even in that ſleep the Angel watched and admoniſhed him by a dream; both of the danger, and the means to eſcape.</p>
                     <p>How great a comfort is it, that when wee ſee ſuch difficulties between us and our deſires, as wee can never overcome, then wee have Gods Angels preſent to do it to our hands? <hi>Mark</hi> 16.3. when the good women that came to imbalme Chriſts body, were very much troubled how to come to his body, and asked who ſhall roul away the ſtone, for it was a very great one, when they looked, they ſaw the ſtone rowlled away, and it was done by the Angel, as <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it. Gods Angels rowl away all ſtones and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, and make our way ſmooth to all good duties.</p>
                     <p>No leſs comfort is it, that when Satan begins to inſult, and makes as if hee would trample upon us, wee have a ſtronger guard about us, any one of the Angels being as able to ſhut the mouth of this roaring Lyon, as they were to ſhut the mouths of thoſe hungry Lyons, into whoſe den <hi>Daniel</hi> was caſt.</p>
                     <p>And for the further ſtrength of our faith and comfort in this Doctrin, the Scripture notes three things further concerning Angels, worth obſerving, 1 Their wiſdome and providence in pitching about us, ſo as wee lye open no where, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.19. when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was gone out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Lord who went before them to lead them out, now removed and went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, becauſe now <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people purſued them. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Angel was no leſſe if hee had ſtayed before them as hee was, being Chriſt himſelf, but for the comfort of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and our inſtruction, the Angel changeth his place, and ſtoppeth between them and the danger. 2 Their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting of themſelves, and ſtrength for our ſafety; one of them readily will help another in helping us: <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13. one Angel being reſiſted by the Prince of the Kingdome of <hi>Perſia, Michael</hi> one of the chief Princes came to help him: who whether hee were an Angel, or (as it is more likely) the Prince and Lord of the Angels, even the Angel of the great Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Chriſt himſelf, it is every way full of comfort. 3 Their patience towards us, who if they ſhould bee gone from us, as often as wee by ſin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them, wee ſhould periſh every moment. But as God is long-ſuffering, ſo hath hee charged his Angels to bee: and therefore they wait ſtill for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and <hi>rejoyce in the repentance of ſinners,</hi> Luke 15.10. and abide in their charge and miniſtery ſtill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Again, this doctrin is a ground of manifold inſtruction.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Hath God afforded us the Miniſtery of Angels? then note the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and preheminence of Gods children, whoſe nature being aſſumed by the Son of God, gives it dignity above the Angels, who are the miniſters of our humane nature in the head and members. Angels are indeed called the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> but that is by creation. Chriſt never gave them this honour to call them brethren. Nay, there is a nearer conjunction between Chriſt and us, than between Chriſt and the Angels, which conjunction doth priviledge us with their attendance. 1 By reaſon of his conception and incarnation, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not of the Angels, by which hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40284:84"/> fleſh of our fleſh. 2 By reaſon of his Spiritual contract, taking us to be one with himſelf, by which we become fleſh of his fleſh, and ſo nearly ſet into him, as the Angels cannot be, who are not members of this Head, as the elect be. Chriſt indeed may bee called their Head, but as a Lord and Commander, nor by ſuch Spiritual union as is between Chriſt and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
                     <p>Herein we may ſee the love of God in ſetting his Angels to be our keepers. The more noble, potent, numerous, and diligent the cuſtody is, the more is the care and love of the thing kept. How great thanks therefore owe wee unto our God, who notwithſtanding he is daily offended with our ſins, yet affords us the miniſtry of his Angels? Who, and what am I, that God is ſo mindful of me, that he ſhould give ſo many glorious Creatures charge over me, that he ſhould give me ſuch a priviledge, that even the holy Angels (whoſe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is in Heaven, and ſee the face of God, who are all ſpirit and no fleſh, who are free from all ſin and miſery) ſhould ſo narrowly attend me a lump of earth, a peece of fleſh, compaſſed with ſo many ſins and miſeries, as I can look no way either before or behind them! <hi>David</hi> in the eighth Pſalm burſt out into the praiſe of God, when he conſidered that God had afforded man the uſe of Birds, Beaſts, and Fiſhes: <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what is man that thou art ſo mindful of him, and haſt preferred him over the works of thy hands!</hi> How much more ſhould we, when we ſee our happineſs by the miniſtery of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Let us learn hence to look to our converſation, <hi>becauſe of the Angels,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. for they are our keepers and obſervers, they ſee all the good and bad we doe, and we doe not ſpeak any thing without many witneſſes. Sin makes God take away our hedge, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.5. it grieves the Angels of God, and lays a man naked to all his Judgements. Shall we willingly offend them, from whom, under God, we receive ſo great and daily comforts? If we did beleeve, or weigh this doctrine, we would not: but becauſe wee ſee not God, nor his Angels, we love neither, nor fear to offend either.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Let us beware of wronging the Children of God, even becauſe they have the protection of the Angels. To riſe up againſt any of them, is to riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Angels their keepers. Offend none of theſe little ones: for their Angels behold the face of their heavenly Father, and thou provokeſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels againſt thee. It the <hi>Sodomites</hi> riſe up againſt <hi>Lot,</hi> the Angels will ſave him and deſtroy them. It <hi>Balaam</hi> will goe to Curſe Gods people, he ſhall have an Angel againſt him with a ſword drawn ready to kill him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Learn wee to give God the honour of our ſalvation and ſafety, when wee have avoyded any danger, publick or private. It is not by chance, nor by our providence and policy, but Gods charging his Angels to ſave and keep us. <hi>Daniel</hi> did rightly aſcribe his deliverance to God, by the miniſtery of the Angel, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.22. <hi>My God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſent his Angel, and ſhut the Lions mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5 To be partaker of all this comfort, theſe means are to bee uſed: 1 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a godly man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.9. <hi>The Angel of the Lord pitcheth his tent round about them that fear the Lord.</hi> Heb. 1.14. <hi>They are miniſtring Spirits to the heirs of ſalvation.</hi> 2 Hold on in a godly courſe, keep thee <hi>in thy ways,</hi> in the duties of thy Calling, general and ſpecial; for thus long the charge of the Angels ſtands in force. 3 Pray (not to Angels, but) to the God of Heaven, to ſend his Angel before thee, to direct and aſſiſt thee in thy duties and ways. For what God hath promiſed, we muſt pray for, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.7. <hi>Abraham</hi> tells his Servant, that God will ſend <hi>his Angel</hi> before him to take a wife for his ſon: and this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel proſpered his Journey, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. And that this was the practice of the Church in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> appears by <hi>Moſes</hi> his meſſage to the King of <hi>Edom,</hi> Numb.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40284:85"/> 20.16. <hi>being ill entreated in Aegypt, we prayed to the Lord, and he ſent an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and brought us out of Aegypt.</hi> I doubt not but this duty, were it more faithfully practiſed, would bring home much more ſucceſs and comfort, than many men find in their labour, who ſcarce know whence or how their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity cometh unto them.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>If God ſhould ſend his Angels in humane form, and as familiarly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with us as anciently they did with the Patriarks, we ſhould beleeve this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: but now there is certainly no ſuch thing.</hi>

                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">Jam. 4.5.</note> I. Chriſt reſiſteth, and yeeldeth not, albeit hee heareth Scripture alleadged. Why? <hi>If yee were of God</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>yee would hear his word:</hi> neither doth Scripture ſpeak any thing in vain. But the reaſon is, 1 Becauſe our Lord perceived that the Word was wreſted and abuſed by Satan: and 2 That Scripture abuſed, binds not to obedience: 3 That Scripture turned out of his right ſenſe, is not Gods Word, but carries ſomething in it beſides Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and then if an Angel from Heaven ſhould bring it, wee muſt bee ſo farre from receiving it, as to hold him accurſed: 4 For our example, that wee ſhould not take all allegations hand over head (but as Chriſt here) try whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they tend; if to caſt us down, refuſe them.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Chriſt reſiſteth, but not without reaſon, but by Scripture, and oppoſeth Scripture to Scripture, not as repugnant one to another, but by way of collation and conferring one with another, that the right uſe of one, may overthrow the abuſe of the other: not in way of contrariety, but of commentary.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But why did not our Saviour ſhut his mouth by telling him how wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had abuſed the text he had alleadged, by adding, detracting, and wreſting it to a contrary end and meaning?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> This might indeed have confounded him ſufficiently: but our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our his Combate is not only victorious for us, but exemplary; and therefore we are herein trained in our fight and encounter: 1 To hold cloſe to the Scripture in anſwering the Devil; <hi>It is written again:</hi> which word of our Saviour noteth how he buckled the Scripture to him, both as a Buckler to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, and as a Sword to foyl and wound his enemy: and ſo muſt wee, who are not ſo able to diſpute with Satan about the true meaning of a place, as our Lord was. 2 To inform us, that the beſt and only way to diſcover the abuſe of Scripture is Scripture, it being the only rule and judge of it ſelf, and all the controverſies riſing out of it. And therefore the Devil, no ſooner heard this teſtimony, but his mouth was ſhut, as well knowing how the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Father had diſcovered his ſubtilty. The beſt Commentary of Scripture is Scripture; every man is the beſt interpreter of himſelf, and ſo
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40284:85"/> the Author of the Scriptures is the beſt interpreter of them. 3 To let us ſee, that although Satan had abuſed the Scripture, yet he nor wee muſt overcome by no other weapon, and that <hi>the abuſe of a thing, takes not away the right uſe of it;</hi> nor good things to be rejected, becauſe they are abuſed by them that can uſe them aright. If Chriſt had been of the Papiſts mind, he would have condemned and ſhut up the Scriptures from common men, becauſe the Devil had abuſed them: for ſo doe they, becauſe Hereticks his inſtruments doe abuſe them, the Laiety may not meddle with them.</p>
                     <p>But it is plain, that in things neceſſary, no abuſe in one, takes away the right uſe in another. As for example: A murderer uſeth a ſword to kill a man; may not another uſe a ſword, or that ſword in his own defence? And are not the Scriptures, <hi>the ſword of the Spirit,</hi> more neceſſary? A Drunkard, a Glutton, a proud perſon, abuſe meat, and drink, and apparel, to ſurfeiting, drunkenneſs, ryot, and exceſs: ſhall wee therefore caſt away meat, drink, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and refuſe the neceſſary uſe of it? And is not the Word a more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary food? Becauſe a Wolf comes in ſheeps cloathing, muſt the ſheep caſt away their fleece? No: the Prophets did not refuſe the Word of the Lord, becauſe the falſe Prophets did ſay, <hi>The Word of the Lord,</hi> as well as they.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>Then it is no good argument, that we muſt reject ſuch and ſuch things, becauſe the Papiſts have abuſed them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> If they be good, and neceſſary, it is not; as are the Word, Prayer, Sacraments, Churches, and whatſoever ſtands by Gods Ordinance in Divine or Civil uſe. But in things unneceſſary, that wee might bee as well, or better without their uſe, it is a good conſequence; Idolaters have abuſed them, therefore we muſt forbear them, as Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>The infallible Judge, and ſpeaking-decider of all Controverſies in the Church, are the holy Scriptures in the true ſenſe of them.</hi> Our Lord here gives the true meaning of one Scripture by another, in this his Controverſie with the Devil. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.9, 10. In any matter of difference, the people muſt come to the Prieſt or Levite, and they muſt judge and determine all differences ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law; and all the people upon pain of death muſt ſtand to that judgement. Now this Prieſt was a type not of the Pope, but of Chriſt, on whoſe mouth all muſt depend for the deciſion of all Controverſies. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.7. the Book of the Law was given to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> to decide all matters among the <hi>Jews,</hi> from which he muſt not depart to the right hand or left hand: He was an eminent type of our <hi>Jeſus</hi> or <hi>Joſhua,</hi> whoſe voyce ſpeaking in the Scripture (the Book of the Law) we muſt attend unto in all things. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures:</hi> and our Saviour ſaid to the Sadduces, <hi>Yee erre, not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> plainly affirming that the Scriptures rightly known, were a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient fence from all errour. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29. <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets; let them hear them.

                     <p n="1">I. The firſt Judge is the Church: for that (ſay they) is to judge of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Scripture; and but for the authority of the Church, wee could not know which were Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We ask what they mean by the Church: They ſay, the Catholick Church. But that is impoſſible to be Judge upon earth, becauſe it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of all the elect in Heaven and Earth, which never was on earth at one time. Then they ſay, the viſible Church. But what if the Church bee not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſometimes, as in <hi>Elias</hi> his time, or be in the Wilderneſs? Then they ſay, the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which hath ever been viſible theſe fifteen hundred years. Now we know our Judge, and how our cauſe is like to goe, in which it is a party. But,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:40284:86"/>1 It is not the Catholike Church, unleſs a finger can bee an hand, or an hand the whole body, or a part become the whole, and falſly and ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call themſelves Catholikes. 2 That is no true Church, which diſagreeth from Chriſt the Head, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, and is fallen off Chriſt by many fundamental errors; as Idolatry, Juſtification by works, and the like; which yet are maintained by Romaniſts. 3 Wee hold that the Orthodox and true Church is, 1 A witneſſe and keeper of the Scriptures: but a jewell hath his price and excellency from it ſelf, not from the keeper. 2 Having the Spirit of Chriſt, the Church can diſcern true Scripture from falſe and ſuppoſititious writings; but this by the help of Scripture: as a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith by the touch-ſtone can diſcern gold from other metals; but hee makes it not gold, but onely tries it ſo to bee. 3 It is to publiſh and declare the truth of Scripture, without adding, or diminiſhing, as an Herald or Cryer manifeſts the Kings pleaſure, but it receives no authority from him. 4 The true Church is a miniſterial interpreter, as having the gift of Prophecy, but ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to interpret and judge of Scripture by Scripture; Chriſt is a magiſterial interpreter.</p>
                     <p>But that the Church on earth ſhould have authority over Scriptures, is too unreaſonable. 1 It is to prefer mens voice and teſtimony above Gods, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.9. <hi>If wee receive mans teſtimony, the teſtimony of God is greater,</hi> Joh. 5. <hi>ult. If yee will not beleeve</hi> Moſes <hi>his writings, how will yee beleeve my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, If yee beleeve not Scriptures, my teſtimony will do you no good. True it is, That our Saviour ſaid, <hi>I receive not teſtimony from man;</hi> that is, I need no mans teſtimony: for <hi>John</hi> gave witneſs to Chriſt: no more doth the Scripture in it ſelf. For Chriſt was the light, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>John</hi> witneſſed to it or no: ſo is the Scripture the Word of God, whether the Church bee witneſs or no. But wee admit the Church to give witneſs but not authority: ſee it in a familiar example: A man owes mee money, I have a bond, and witneſſes, hee denies it, I produce the bond, and the witneſſes, that clear the matter, and affirm the bond to bee his act and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; do theſe now make the bond true, or the debt good, or onely clear it ſo to bee? for if they ſhould not witneſs, the debt and bond were true: Even ſuch is the witneſſe of the Church to the Scripture. 2 The voice of the Spouſe is inferiour to the voice of the bridegroom, and howſoever a man may bee moved by the Church to hear the Scripture if hee bee unconverted, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> being a <hi>Maniche,</hi> yet a man indued with Gods Spirit, and the gift of faith, eſteems the Scripture for it ſelf above all the words of all men, as Chriſt himſelf at length was of far more authority than the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when the men thereof ſaid to her, <hi>Now wee beleeve not for thy word, but becauſe our ſelves have heard him.</hi> So as when wee have the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt asking us (as every one of them doth, when the Word hath put them to their ſhifts:) But how do you know Scripture to bee Scripture but by the Church? wee muſt anſwer, by the Scripture, taking with us the help of the Church, and eſpecially by the Spirit of God revealing the truth unto us: <hi>for the ſheep of Chriſt hear his voice, and follow him.</hi> And when wee aske the Papiſts, how they know the Church to bee the Church, or where it is, ſome ſay it is here, ſome there, ſome hold us off with one mark, ſome with another; but at laſt they come to know the Church by Scripture; and that is the Church which the Scripture ſaith is the Church: ſo in all other queſtions, that muſt bee the determination which the Scripture deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Church cannot bee judge, becauſe it muſt bee judged by Chriſts voice, and not bee a Law unto it. Common-wealths muſt receive Laws from the Prince, and not the Prince from his people: and as it is in bodies politick, ſo in the myſtical body of Chriſt. And as in the natural body the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40284:87"/> head ruleth the members, not contrarily, ſo is it here.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 How abſurd is it to affirm, that that which is ſubject to error, muſt bee judge and ſuperiour to that which is free from it? But the Church may erre, even the true Catholike Church on Earth, may erre, and doth when it departeth never ſo little from the Scripture, although it cannot depart from the foundation, nor incorrigibly erre: for every man may erre, and therefore that which conſiſts of every man: even the Apoſtle was compaſſed with infirmity. Beſides, the main difference between the Church militant and triumphant, is, that one may erre, the other is quite freed from error.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The ſecond judge and decider of controverſies, appointed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are the Doctors and Fathers: but how corruptly? for, 1 They conſent not among themſelves, and ſeldome agree in the ſame ſenſe. 2 They borrow all the light and truth they have from the Scripture, as the ſtars from the Sun. 3 All their doctrin muſt bee judged of by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and only ſo far received as they agree with it. 4 They all preſent their writings to bee examined by Scripture, and ſo, many things in them are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judged erroneous, even in the beſt of them. If I ſpeak, let none hear me; but if God ſpeak, woe to him that hears not. It muſt not go for current, This ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>

Their third judge and decider of controverſies are Councils, which (ſay they) is the Church repreſentative: but theſe are as unfit to be Judges of the Scripture as the former: For, 1 Even the general Councils diſagree among themſelves in interpreting Scripture, as might bee ſeen in a number of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 2 The Popes Canon Law it ſelf affirmeth, that all the Councils (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the four general, namely the <hi>Nicen, Anno</hi> 332. <hi>Epheſius, Anno</hi> 450. of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>

Alſo it erred in the matter of Miniſters mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſtayed by <hi>Paphnutius.</hi> And the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Council gave all equal honour and authority to the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> which the Papiſts themſelves generally hold to be a great error, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was none.

                     <p n="3">3 There was a true ſenſe and interpretation of Scripture in the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of theſe general Councils.

                     <p n="4">4 The Councils themſelves determined by the Scriptures of the Scriptures as the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> general Council, where <hi>Conſtantine</hi> enjoyned, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40284:87"/> they determined all according to Scripture. It ſeems in thoſe daies the Scriptures were above Councils: and ſince Councils and Decrees of men got wings to fly above the Scriptures, it was never well, as one of themſelves ſpeaketh.

Why then ſhould Proteſtant-Preachers, who defend againſt Papiſts the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Scripture to make Gods people perfect, and hold it the rule and ſquare of all doctrin, croſs their judgement by their practice? for every place of Scripture alleadging a dozen or twenty teſtimonies of Doctors, Fathers, Councils, nay, prophane Poets and Heathens; all which are darkneſs it ſelf, and without light, further than they borrow from the Sun in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>I am not ſo nice, as that I think not there may be a ſparing and ſober uſe of

Neither am I an enemy to Learning, but would have a man well ſeen in natural <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> in humane literature, in the writings of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Schoolmen, and bee as a good houſholder ſtored with <hi>things new and old.</hi> But needleſly, and for oſtentation, to give tongues unto dead men, and in the meſſage of God, to put to ſilence the voice of God, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Scripture, to ſet up <hi>Hagar</hi> the handmaid above <hi>Sarah</hi> her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, is a fearful ſin againſt God and his Word, and a crying ſin of theſe daies; wherein for a man to tye himſelf cloſe to the Scriptures without ſuch flouriſhes, and to ſcorn to ſend a rich Jewel to the Painter, is to bring a blot on himſelf, that hee is a man of no learning. For what meaneth elſe that common cry, that no man is againſt this manner of preaching, but they that cannot uſe it? Well hath hee learned his art that can moſt hide it here, that God may have all the glory: for hee is not commended here, whom men praiſe, but whom God alloweth.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtolical teaching of Chriſt was not in words which mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome teacheth, but Gods: hee is the beſt Scholar that can teach Chriſt plainlieſt: and for my part, if I would ſet my ſelf to bee idle, I would chuſe that kinde of preaching which is counted ſo laborious. The ſame I ſay for diſputations and controverſies in the Church and Schools: never can we look for an end of them, till wee tye the determination of them to the Scripture alone, the right Judge. A ſtratagem of Satan for Antichriſt to flye the Scripture which ſhould ſoon end controverſies, and hide his poyſon in the infinite windings of Fathers, Councils, Traditions, &amp;c. Well I know, that God hath a ſecret work in puniſhing the unbeleeving world, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the <hi>man of ſin</hi> till his time come: but having well thought of the props on which hee ſtandeth, yet in the daies of ſuch light, there is none that doth him more ſervice, than this hiding of his myſtery in ſuch a thicket of uncertainties, wherein it is impoſſible to come to any end or iſſue. Wee may follow the fox from one burrough to another, and from hole to hole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are forced. But whoſoever looks to come to an end of controverſies, by following him from Father to Father, from Council to Council, from one Decree to another, from one Tradition to another, with infinite la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour examining and ſcanning the words and ſyllables of ancient and latter times, hee ſhall fall ſhort of his expectation: For all this while the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Controverſy is not preſent but ſet aſide.</p>
                     <p>And what other Reaſon can bee given, that whereas the chaſe and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute of that <hi>beaſt</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been continued with extraordinary ſpeed and ſtrength for above theſe hundred years laſt paſt, and hee hath been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed into every hole wherein hee hid himſelf, yet the controverſies ſo bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and canvaſed, are in mans eye as far from compoſition or determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as at firſt, not one of them yeelded up on either hand? I ſay, no other better reaſon can bee given, but that wee are not agreed of the Judge of the cauſe, and ſo long as they can hold them off the Scriptures, they will not bee ſet down by any other authority.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>1</label> The <hi>firſt</hi> is that in our text, <hi>conference of Scripture:</hi> there the Spirit of God by plain places expoundeth thoſe which are more difficult. Thus <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.8. <hi>Ezra</hi> opened the Scripture, by comparing it with it ſelf, and ſo made the people to underſtand, as <hi>Junius</hi> noteth out of the original. So the <hi>Bereans</hi> having heard the doctrine of the Apoſtles, <hi>ſearched the Scriptures;</hi> that is, compared their doctrine with the doctrine of the Old Teſtament. Thus the Apoſtles themſelves, teaching Chriſts reſurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16. prove it out of the Old Teſtament: <hi>viz.</hi> Pſal. 16.10. <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> And to prove that thoſe words cannot be meant of <hi>David</hi> himſelf, he appeals to another teſtimony in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. where it is ſaid, that <hi>David ſlept with his fathers,</hi> and lay buried in his Sepulchre, and ſo ſaw corruption. This is a ſpecial way whereby <hi>the Scripture giveth wiſdom to the ſimple,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. And for this purpoſe the Lord hath in great wiſdom tempered the Scripture with ſome hard places, to <hi>exerciſe</hi> mens <hi>ſenſes,</hi> and try their diligence in comparing of Scripture, whereof there were no need if there were no hard places. How comes it that many pervert, the Scripture to their own deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but becauſe they conferre not one part with another, which would lead them into the right ſenſe? How come the <hi>Arrians,</hi> when they hear Chriſt ſay, <hi>The Father is greater than I,</hi> and other ſuch ſayings, to hold to the death that Chriſt is not true God, co-eſſential and co-equal with his Father, but that they doe not compare this with other places? as <hi>Job.</hi> 1.1. <hi>That word was God;</hi> Philip. 2.6. <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equal with God;</hi> Rom. 9. — which is <hi>God bleſſed for ever.</hi> And conſequently, that the former place ſpeaks of his Human nature, the latter of his Divine nature.</p>
                     <p>How could the Papiſts ſuffer ſhipwrack of faith, and Heretically erre in the foundation of Religion, teaching juſtification by the works of the Law out of <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Was not</hi> Abraham <hi>our father juſtified by works?</hi> but that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre not other places to help them into the right ſenſe? as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. and 3.20. <hi>We are juſtified by faith, without the works of the law:</hi> and, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not by the works of righteouſneſs which we had done, but according to his grace he ſaved us.</hi> Which places being compared ſhew, that one ſpeaks of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before God, as <hi>Paul;</hi> the other of juſtification before men, as <hi>James;</hi> the former of juſtifying the perſon, the latter of juſtifying the faith of the perſon.</p>
                     <p>When they read ſuch places as theſe, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt,</hi> and, <hi>Turn you, turn you, O houſe of Iſrael;</hi> hence they conclude, man hath free-will in his own converſion. Whereas, would they compare theſe with other places,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40284:90"/> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>The whole imagination of mans heart is only evil continually;</hi> and, <hi>it is God that works both the will and the deed, &amp;c.</hi> the reconciling of ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would force them to ſee, that till God work us, wee are meer patients, and after that, <hi>acts agimus,</hi> being moved we move: for his grace muſt not bee idle in us.</p>
                     <p>The lewd and diſordered Libertine, when he reads that wee are juſtified by faith without works, caſts off all care of his converſation: What can his works doe? what need they? But he could not thus pervert the Scripture to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, if he compared it with ſuch Scriptures as ſay, that <hi>faith without works is dead:</hi> and, <hi>that faith works by love.</hi> The reconciling whereof would teach them, that although works be excluded from juſtification, yet not from faith: they muſt bee in the perſon juſtified, though not in the juſtification of his perſon.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>conference of Scripture,</hi> is either in places parallel and like, or in ſuch as ſeem to be oppoſed, and unlike.</p>
                     <p>The conferring of like places bringeth great light to the reader.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 3. In all doubtful places, let us ever receive that expoſition, which is according to the Analogy of faith: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. <hi>If any man propheſy,</hi> that is, have a <hi>gift of interpreting,</hi> let him interpret according to the <hi>analogy of Faith:</hi> So that if the letter of a Scripture croſs the Analogy of Faith, that is, agree not with the ſum of the Doctrin of Faith, contained in the Decalogue, Creed, and Lords prayer, it muſt bee underſtood by a figure. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Where the Text ſaith, <hi>This is my body:</hi> ſeeing the literal ſenſe fighteth with the Article of Faith, by which wee beleeve that Chriſt is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven, and ſitteth at the right hand of God, till hee return to judge the quick and the dead, it muſt bee underſtood in the figure, uſual to Sacraments, by which the thing ſignified is put for the ſign: and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe. So, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. <hi>Many ſins were forgiven her, for ſhe loved much:</hi> to gather hence merit of Remiſſion for our works of Charity, with the Papiſts, is againſt the ground of faith, by which wee beleeve remiſſion of ſins, which is directly oppoſite ro merit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 4. Great diligence muſt bee uſed to diſcern the right ſcope of the place doubted of; which being neglected, makes way to manifold errours. See an inſtance: The good <hi>Samaritan</hi> ſhewed mercy to the man that fell among Theeves, and was left half dead, and wounded. Now to gather hence, with the Papiſts, that men are but half dead in ſin, and being a little holpen by grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40284:92"/> and wander beyond, and beſide the ſcope of the place; which is, to ſhew who is our neighbour, and what Charity binds us to, and not what we can do of our ſelves. Beſides, being a parable, it proves nothing beſides the main ſcope. Elſe one might hence prove, that of all men Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites are moſt unmerciful, and that there is chance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 5. If a doubt riſe out of a promiſe or threat, know that they are all conditional, although the condition bee not expreſſed. <hi>Yet forty daies, and</hi> Ninivey <hi>ſhall bee deſtroyed;</hi> with a ſecret condition, except <hi>Ninivey</hi> repent. So a Promiſe of long life is made to the godly, and yet they often dye young: therefore a ſecret condition muſt bee underſtood, thus, unleſs God ſee it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to take them away young from the evil to come. Iſa. 38.1. <hi>See thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye, and not live:</hi> yet <hi>Hezekiah</hi> lived fifteen years afterward: Therefore there muſt bee underſtood the condition of Gods Will, which was concealed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.3. <hi>God ſaid to</hi> Abimelech, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye for the woman,</hi> yet hee dyed not: the exception was, <hi>unleſs thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore her.</hi> See this rule at large in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13, 14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 6. Neither ſtick too faſt to the letter, nor yet inſiſt too much in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories or metaphors. The Jews greatly ſinned in the firſt, and are yet held from their converſion by this plot of the Devil. For as the multitude of them in the Prophets time, while the Ceremonial Law ſtood in force, ſtuck to the outward Ceremony and Letter, and offered Sacrifices and Beaſts, and did ſuch things as were commanded, but went no further; they waſhed the outſide, but not the inſide; they offered the blood of Beaſts, but roſe not ſo high as the blood of Chriſts they killed the Bullocks and Sheep, but not their ſins, nor took notice of that mortification of corruption, which theſe would have put them in minde of: So at this day, reading the Prophecies of Chriſts ſpritual Kingdome, ſet out under the types of moſt flouriſhing temporal Kingdomes, they ſtick in the Letter, and loſe the ſenſe, denying the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to bee come, becauſe they ſee not that flouriſhing eſtate, and temporal happineſs, which they groſly and carnally imagine.</p>
                     <p>This was the judgement of God upon <hi>Origen,</hi> who was in ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in both theſe, that although his wit ſerved him to turn all the Scripture almoſt into allegories, yet hee ſtood moſt abſurdly to the very letter: as in that of <hi>Matth.</hi>

                     <p>So on the contrary, many Hereticks have defended their Hereſies onely by tranſlating of Scriptures into Allegories.

                     <p>The Papiſts denying the Marriage of Miniſters, hearing the Apoſtle ſay, that a <hi>Biſhop muſt bee the Husband of one Wife,</hi> turn it into an Allegory (I had like to have ſaid a jeſt:) Hee muſt, they ſay bee the Biſhop of one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick; as though his children muſt not bee governed in his own houſe, which is plainly diſtinguiſhed from his Dioceſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4, 5.

                        <hi>Rule</hi> 7. In every ſmall diverſity and difference in numbers, which are hiſtorically mentioned, wee muſt not ſuſpect errour in the Scripture, but our own ignorance. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.14. <hi>All the ſouls which came with</hi> Jacob <hi>into</hi> Egypt, <hi>were ſeventy five:</hi> but in <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.27. <hi>They were ſeventy ſouls.</hi> Here are five odds.

                     <p>But howſoever, according to our rule, the Spirit of God often in ſetting down numbers, uſeth the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> a part for the whole, and in a diverſe reſpect putteth down a greater or leſſe number, As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:</p>
                     <p>1 King. 9.28. <hi>Solomon ſent his ſervants, who took from</hi> Ophir <hi>four hundred and twenty talents of Gold:</hi> 2 Chron. 8.30. <hi>Hee took thence four hundred and fifty talents of Gold.</hi> Here is thirty talents odds.</p>

As in this example: Matth. 27.9. <hi>It was fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet</hi> Jeremy: whereas it was ſpoken by <hi>Zachary, chap.</hi> 11.13. and not by <hi>Jeremy.</hi> Many learned men trouble themſelves more than needs in reconciling this place. 1 Some ſay that Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> joynes together both one place in <hi>Jeremy, chap.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3. of the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and this of <hi>Zachary,</hi> 11.13. But there is little or no agreement between
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40284:93"/> them. 2 Some ſay, that it is not in <hi>Jeremies</hi> writings that are Canonical, but in ſome Apocryphal writings of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> which the <hi>Jewes</hi> had, and which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> confeſſeth he ſaw, wherein theſe words were. But it is not likely, that the holy Evangeliſt would leave a Canonical text, and cite an Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal; or give ſuch credit to that, or ſeek to build our faith upon it. And by our rule that Book ſhould be Canonical, 3 Some ſay, that <hi>Matthew</hi> forgat, and for <hi>Zaehary</hi> put down <hi>Jeremy:</hi> but with more forgetfulneſs, that holy men writ as they were moved by Gods Spirit. This error <hi>Eraſmus</hi> takes hold of, from <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who in his third Book concerning the conſent of the Evangeliſts, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. defendeth and excuſeth this error. 4 Some think it the error of heedleſs Writers, who might eaſily ſo erre: but all the oldeſt Copies, and the moſt ancient Fathers have the name of <hi>Jeremy.</hi> 5 Some ſay, that <hi>Zachariah</hi> being inſtructed and trained up with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> did deliver it by tradition from <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and ſo <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpoke it by <hi>Zachariah:</hi> which might be true, becauſe it is ſaid in the text, As was <hi>ſpoken</hi> by <hi>Jeremy,</hi> not, <hi>written.</hi> But 6 The moſt compendious and likely way of reconciling is this, that <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> was the ſame man, having two names, which was very uſual among the Jews: as <hi>Gedeon</hi> was called <hi>Jerubaal</hi> and <hi>Jerub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">II. <hi>In direct meeting the Devils drift,</hi> which was to move Chriſt to vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and make trial whether he was the Son of God, or God his Father, by throwing himſelf down. Comparing this place with the former, he ſhewes him, that it gives him no leave to caſt down himſelf: for this were not to truſt God, but to tempt God, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did in <hi>Maſſah:</hi> but I doubt not of my Fathers power, and therefore I need not try it. I diſtruſt not the truth of his promiſe, and preſence with me, what need I make trial of it? I have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which I muſt not ſeparate from the promiſe, as thou doeſt. Thou pretendeſt a promiſe, but no promiſe extends to the breach of any Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, but hath his ground and dependance upon ſome Commandement or other. Thou wouldeſt have me caſt my ſelf down, and promiſeſt help, but no promiſe can ſecure him, that attempteth that wherein he tempteth God, as this action would.</p>
                     <p>In the words are, 1 The perſon that muſt not tempt, <hi>Thou:</hi> 2 The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that muſt not be tempted, <hi>The Lord thy God:</hi> 3 The action of tempting, <hi>not tempt.</hi>

But, 1 It was never written, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſhould not tempt Chriſt: if it had, it had been falſe. 2 It is a negative Commandement of God, directed to his people, which bindes all perſons, at all times, in all places; and not to bee reſtrained to this occaſion. 3 Satan was irrecoverably fallen from the Covenant of grace; and ſo, although Chriſt was his Lord in reſpect of his power, yet not his God in reſpect of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, which thoſe words have ſpecial reſpect unto. 4 Satan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to tempt him ſtill, and therefore that is not the meaning. 5 Chriſt in this humble eſtate would not manifeſt himſelf, much leſs call himſelf Lord and God.</p>

The perſon who muſt not be tempted, <hi>The Lord:</hi> if hee be a Lord, hee muſt be feared, obeyed, honoured, not tempted or provoked. <hi>Thy God:</hi> though he be my God and my Father, I muſt not preſume, I muſt not abuſe my Fathers goodneſs and providence where no need is. A loyal ſubject will not preſume upon the clemency of his Prince, to break his Lawes, or a loving childe upon his fathers goodneſs, to offend him.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The action of <hi>tempting.</hi> To <hi>tempt God,</hi> is to prove and try God (out of neceſſity) what he can doe, or what he will doe, and whether he be ſo good, ſo merciful, ſo juſt, as his word and promiſe ſay he is: ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tempted me, and proved me, and ſaw my works.</hi> The mother of this ſin is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and unbelief, 1 Of Gods power, as if his arm were ſhortned: 2 Of his goodneſs, as if he were not ſo careful of his choſen as he is.

Or when ſuch an extraordinary work or calling is to bee made manifeſt to the World to bee from God, for the better proſpering of Gods work, a man may deſire a ſign, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. and <hi>Elijah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 When God gives an extraordinary promiſe to his Servants, of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething above all they can ſee or expect, hee pleaſeth to condeſcend to their weakneſs, and for confirming of their Faith hee bears them asking a ſign: as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> being extraordinarily reſtored, ſeeing 1 His own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream weakneſſe; and 2 The Word of God paſſed, <hi>Set thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt not live but dye,</hi> required a ſign: and God afforded him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had ſuch an extraordinary promiſe as never was, to bee a Mother without the knowledge of man; ſhee asked how that could bee: God gave her a ſign, ſaying, <hi>Thy couſin</hi> Elizabeth <hi>hath conceived, and ſhall bear a Son, and ſo ſhalt thou.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 When anextraordinary teſtimony to a new form of Doctrin is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, extraordinary ſigns may be required. As for example: The Goſpell at the firſt publiſhing of it, was joyned with the aboliſhment of all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, and all the Ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and bringing in a new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (in reſpect of the manner) through the world, againſt which both Jews and Gentiles could not but bee deadly enemies. Now the Apoſtles did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and obtain the power of working many ſignes and wonders, of healing, killing, raiſing the dead, commanding Devils, and the like.</p>
                     <p>But to ask a ſign out of theſe caſes, is a provoking and tempting of God: as 1. Out of diffidence or malice, as the Jews <hi>bad Chriſt come down from the Croſs, and they would beleeve him,</hi> aſſuring themſelves hee was never able to do that. 2 For curioſity and delight; as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> deſired to ſee ſome marvail; or for ſatisfying our Luſt, as <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 3 For our own private ends, not aiming directly at Gods glory, and denial of our ſelves; as the Jews followed Chriſt, not for his <hi>Miracles,</hi> but for their <hi>belly,</hi> and the <hi>bread:</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> herein failed, requiring a Miracle of Chriſt, rather for a prevention of ſcandal for the want of wine, than the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting of Chriſts glory; for which Chriſt checked her: for it was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and light reſpect, to which miracles muſt not bee commanded, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.4. 4 For confirming of that Doctrin and Authority, which is ſufficiently confirmed already, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Shew us a ſign, why thou doeſt theſe things,</hi> why thou whippeſt out buyers and ſellers out of the Temple. Hee ſhews them none, they tempt God herein; was not the whipping of them out, and the Authority hee had ſhewn, ſign enough of his divine authority? did not hee ſolely and alone overthrow and turn out a number of them without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? did not he by his word, challenge the Temple to bee his Fathers houſe, and himſelf the Son of God? Having thus confirmed his authority by this ſign, hee would ſhew them no other.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Papiſts as a Phariſaical ſeed tempt God, looking for more mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to confirm the ſame Doctrin, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confirmed by many and powerful Miracles. When they prove that wee teach another D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">III. <hi>To tempt God in action,</hi> is thus: 1 To enter upon any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Calling: for that is to ſtep out of our way, when wee do that which wee have neither Word nor Promiſe for: this is in the Text. 2 To walk in a courſe of ſin, and live in our wickedneſſe, eſpecially when the Lord by bleſſings moveth us to repentance. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.15. <hi>They that work wickedneſs bee ſet up:</hi> who bee they? in the next words the Prophet ſheweth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>They that tempt God are delivered.</hi> So as all wicked perſons are Tempters of God. 3 To preſume upon extraordinary means, when ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means may bee had: Thus the three worthies of <hi>David</hi> tempted God, that went for water in danger of their lives, whereas they might have had it nearer in ſafety, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.15. but when they brought it to him, hee conſidered how they had ſinned to ſatisfy his ſinful deſire, and would not drink it.

                     <p>Our Saviour would here teach us what a dangerous ſin it is to tempt the Lord, it being ſo abſolutely forbidden the people of God, not only in the Old Teſtament, but in the New. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted him.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 It is a manifeſt argument of infidelity, and hardneſs of heart. When a friend promiſeth me to doe me good at my need, or to ſtand by me in time of danger, I will feign a need or danger, to try whether he will be as good as his word or no; what doth this but imply a ſuſpicion in me, that my friend will not be as good as his word, therefore I will try him before I need him? And thus he deals, that will needleſly tempt God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 No relation between God and us may encourage us to tempt him.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This ſerves to diſcover unto us, our fayling againſt this doctrine, and that every of us cannot ſo eaſily put off this ſin as we think for.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Is it not ordinary amongſt us that read the Word, and of Gods power therein? we hear his promiſes, we taſte by experience how good and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God is, and yet in any ſtraight, in every danger, we can be ready to <hi>tempt him, as in Maſſah,</hi> ſaying in our hearts, Is God with me? Doth God regard me? Am I not clean caſt out of ſight? Can I ever be holpen, and ſwim out of this diſtreſs? Thus the unbelief of our hearts is ready to make God a Lyar. When there was a marvellous great famine in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid, <hi>To morrow at this time two meaſures of barly ſhall bee at a ſhekel, and a meaſure of fine flower at a ſhekel:</hi> a Prince anſwered, <hi>If the Lord would make windowes in Heaven, could it be ſo?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Thine eyes ſhall ſee it, but thou ſhalt not eat of it.</hi> And hee was trodden in peeces in the gate for his unbelief. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 How generally are we in love with our ſins, which out of <hi>Malachi,</hi> we have ſhewed to be a tempting of God? God hath poured abundant mercies upon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40284:95"/> us the people of <hi>England,</hi> yet we goe on to provoke and tempt him; the more his mercies, the more our ſins: how can this abuſing of goodneſs but heap up wrath againſt our ſelves. Can there bee a greater tempting of God in his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, than to goe on and trade in ſin without repentance, preſuming that God will not puniſh us? What a number of notorious wicked perſons are reſolved to adde drunkenneſs to thirſt, and ſin to ſin, and yet at laſt mean to be ſaved?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 How hardly can we bee kept from wicked companies and occaſions? Though we be warned by Chriſts voyce ſpeaking in the Word, as <hi>Peter</hi> was, yet we thruſt into <hi>Caiaphas</hi> his hall, and the Players Hall, which is the Devils School, and will not avoyd occaſions, till the end of ſin bring ſorrow and bitterneſs incurable. How eaſily doe men loſe the watch over themſelves, againſt their own reſolutions, and the motions of Gods Word and Spirit? when they might redeem their precious time, gained from their ſpecial cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the general, in reading, meditating, prayer, &amp;c. preſently the Devil thruſts them out of both callings, to gaming, drinking, or bowling, or ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable exerciſes. O when God layes you on your Death-bed, this one ſorrow (if God ever give you ſenſe of your eſtate) will be ready to ſink you; that you have looſely and unfruitfully parted with your time, and now you cannot buy an after-noon to bewail the loſs of many in, with all your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 How prone are we to venture and ruſh upon any thing without a calling, or without a warrant? as when men caſt themſelves into unneceſſary dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, hoping that God will deliver them. Many run on an head into unlawful contracts, without care of any word to guide them. Others ſtrike the hand, and undoe themſelves by Suretiſhip. Others caſt off profitable callings, and betake themſelves to unprofitable and hurtful; as Uſurers, and their Bawds; and keepers of Smoke-ſhops. And ſome will run upon ropes for praiſe or profit. In all this men are out of their way, and in a courſe of tempting God. Would a man caſt himſelf into the Sea, in hope he ſhould never be drowned; or on a perſwaſion he ſhould never be burnt, caſt himſelf into the fire? Wee having ſtayrs, are prone to leap down: Chriſt our Lord would not doe ſo.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 How common a thing is it both in matters of ſoul and body, to ſever the means from the end, which is a plain tempting of God, as our Saviour here calleth it? Every man hopes to goe to Heaven, but never ſeeks the way.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. What a number will be ſaved by Miracle? for means they will uſe none: faith, repentance, knowledge, mortification, ſanctification, they are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, yea enemies unto. God fed the <hi>Jewes</hi> miraculouſly in the Wilderneſs, not in <hi>Canaan,</hi> not in <hi>Aegypt</hi> where means were. Chriſt fed many people by Miracle in the Wilderneſs, but being near the City, <hi>he bought bread,</hi> Joh. 4.8. God will never feed thee with the heavenly Mannah by Miracle, where the means are to be had, but are neglected.</p>
                     <p>How many will either be ſaved as the Thief was on the Croſs, or they will never be ſaved? they make their ſalvation but an hours work, and make as ſhort a matter of it as <hi>Balaam,</hi> who would but <hi>dye the death of the righteous.</hi> What a tempting of God is this, as if a man would adde his Oath unto Gods, that he ſhall <hi>never enter into his rest?</hi> Chriſt hath ſufficiently ſet forth his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power by that example of him on the Croſs, he need not, nor will not doe it again, in ſaving thee by miracle. It is a better argument, Chriſt ſaved the Thief at the laſt hour on the Croſs, therefore he will not ſo ſave me, than otherwiſe. VVhat a common ſin is it to neglect the means, and deſpiſe the word, as a weak and ſilly means, as the Preachers be ſilly men? Oh, if wee had greater means, ſome man from the dead, or ſome Angel from Heaven, or
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40284:96"/> ſome miracles, we could bee better perſwaded. A great tempting of God: as though his wiſdome had failed in appointing ſufficient means for the faith of his people. Chriſt reproved this infidelity, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.48. <hi>Except yee ſee ſigns and wonders, yee will not beleeve.</hi> Notably <hi>Luther: If God ſhould offer me a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I would refuſe it, I am ſo confirmed in the truth of the word.</hi> How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doe men ſtand out the threats of the Word, plainly denounced againſt their ſin, even in their own conſciences; which is nothing but to tempt God, and try whether he will be ſo juſt and ſtrict?</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>In the things of this life men tempt God many ways.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 Idle perſons are tempters of God, that for working might releeve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs, but they will not, and yet hope to live: whoſe preſumptuous tempting of him, God revengeth either by giving them over to ſtealing, and ſo they fall into the Magiſtrates hand, or he hardens mens hearts againſt them, that they finde not that good in an idle and wandring life which they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe muſt have water out of a rock, and be extraordinarily fed, thruſting themſelves out of the ordinary courſe which God hath put all fleſh under: <hi>viz. By the ſweat of thy brows, thou ſhalt get thy bread.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 The omitting of any ordinary means of our good, or over-prizing of any means, is a tempting of God to take them from us, and a revenging of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though the Lord ſay he ſhall live fifteen years, muſt not omit means, but take dry figgs, and lay to the apoſtem. <hi>Aſa</hi> muſt not truſt to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: for then he ſhall never come off his bed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 In our trials, when wee murmure, grudge, make haſte, or uſe unlawful means, we tempt God, and incur this great ſin. So as none of us can waſh our hands of it, but it will ſtick with us: and we had need daily to repent of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it daily thruſts us under the diſpleaſure of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Labour we to nouriſh our confidence of Gods power and mercy, which is an oppoſite unto this ſin, and ſtrive againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>By what means?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> By obſerving theſe rules: 1 See that in every thing, thou haſt Gods word and warrant for what thou doeſt: ſay not, I hope I may doe this or that; but I know I may doe it. If thou haſt a word, thou mayeſt be bold without tempting God: that is the ground of faith, and tempting of God is from infidelity. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.34. when <hi>Paul</hi> was in extream peril, he tells the Mariners, they ſhould come ſafe to land. Why, what was his ground? even a ſpecial word; the <hi>Angel of God told him that night, that none ſhould periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Walk with God, as <hi>Enoch,</hi> provoke him not by ſin, then mayeſt thou pray unto God, and ſecure thy ſelf under his wing in danger without tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. So long as a man hath a good conſcience with <hi>Paul,</hi> and an upright heart with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he may bee bold with God, and rejoyce in himſelf, and aſſure himſelf that Gods power and juſtice is his; he will not ſink in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not ſay, <hi>Is God with me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 Vſe the means conſcionably, which God hath appointed for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good ends. <hi>Paul</hi> had a word, that they ſhould all come ſafe to land; yet they muſt not caſt themſelves into the ſea, nor goe out of the ſhip. Never did any promiſe of God make the godly careleſs in the means. <hi>Daniel</hi> had a promiſe of return out of <hi>Babylon</hi> after ſeventy years, and knew they ſhould return: and turning the Book, and finding the time expired, hee uſeth the means, and is diligent with <hi>faſting and prayer,</hi> that God would accompliſh his word, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Jacob</hi> had a promiſe of God, that hee ſhould return into his Country, he knew all the Devils in Hell could not hinder the promiſe; yet ſeeing his brother <hi>Eſaus</hi> wrath was a ſtop or bar, hee uſeth means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this let; he goes to God, and wraſtles with him by prayer, then he ſends his preſents, and orders his droves with all the wiſdome hee could; and by
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40284:96"/> this means prevented the danger. Chriſt himſelf having ſtairs, will uſe them. Remember for ſpiritual life and natural, hee muſt eat that would live: for ſpiritual war and temporal, hee muſt carry his weapons that would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: for earthly and heavenly harveſt, hee that would reap muſt ſow. The ſick needs the Phyſician. In our earthly or heavenly travel, let us with <hi>Jacob</hi> prevent whatſoever lets would hinder us from our Countrey, or the end of our way.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Whether thou ſeeſt means or no, ſubject thy will to Gods in all things. <hi>If hee kill thee, yet truſt in him ſtill. David</hi> in the want of means of comfort, ſaid, <hi>Behold, here am I, let the Lord do whatſoever is good in his eyes.</hi> The three Children ſeeing no means of eſcape, anſwered the King thus, <hi>Our God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deliver us; and if hee will not, yet wee will not worſhip thy Image:</hi> wee are ſure of his preſence, either for the preſervation of our bodies, or the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſouls.</p>

And why? 1 This is the Apoſtles Counſel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. becauſe Satan is a continual enemy, therefore wee muſt bee ſober and watch. 2 Where hee is caſt out, hee ſeeks re-entry, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24. 3 Though God of his grace often reſtrain his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, it is not to make men ſecure, but to have a breathing time to fit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better for further tryal. 4 Security after victory in temporal warre, hath proved dangerous, and hath loſt more than all their valour had won; as the <hi>Amalekites</hi> having taken a great ſpoil of <hi>Davids,</hi>

                     <p>The like reſtleſneſſe wee note in the Jews, the wicked enemies of Chriſt, who were ſo thirſty of his blood, and nothing elſe could ſerve them, and no means could hinder them, but they conſult in their Hall, how they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, they ſend out in the night to apprehend him; being come to catch him, hee with a word ſtruck them all to the ground, yet they go on: having apprehended him, they keep him all night in <hi>Caiaphas</hi> his Hall, and at the break of the day, <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High Prieſt, the Elders, Scribes, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſces, held a ſolemn Councill to put him to death: And when his gracious words confounded them, and they ſaw his innocency ſhine out, when they heard the Judge clearing him, and ſaw him waſh his hands from his blood, yet they grew more violent, and called his <hi>blood</hi> upon <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>their children</hi> for ever. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.6. when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would ſacrifize to the golden calfe, they roſe up <hi>early in the morning.</hi> Wee ſhall ever ſee wicked men in their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſes make more haſte, than good ſpeed: and the more oppoſed, the more violent. <hi>Aaron</hi> durſt not reſiſt them.

                     <p>There are three ſpecial things, wherein men do moſt expreſly imitate Satan and manifeſt his image upon themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In inceſſant malice againſt God, and his Children. Satan was a man-ſlayer from the beginning, and ſo in the beginning was his Son <hi>Cain,</hi> who hated his brother, and ſlew him, <hi>becauſe his works were good, and his own evil,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. Of this progeny were the curſed Jews that went about to kill Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. and all thoſe that hate and malign the Children of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In ſlandering and falſe accuſing:
<note place="margin">Rev. 12.10.</note> for Satan is called the accuſer of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> and ſo are they, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. Calumniation is the conſtitutive form of Satan, and the Jews had an expreſs Image of it upon them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.60. How do they compaſs their malice againſt Chriſt? thus, they ſought falſe witneſs, and thereby played the Devils: firſt, they deſired to have two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but they would not ſerve; then two more, but they alſo would not ſerve (and mark by the way, it ſeems they examined them apart;) at laſt ſome came that accorded, and upon their word they condemned Chriſt. All the while they will ſeem to take a courſe of Law, juſtice, and equity: but all is but a colour. 1 Though, according to their plot, they muſt put Chriſt to death unjuſtly, yet themſelves do not deviſe ſlanders, but onely are willing that any ſhould come in and ſpeak againſt him in ſomewhat, they will have two witneſſes: it was enough for Magiſtrates to receive witneſs, not to bee judges and accuſers themſelves. Beſides this, they will not deal under-hand, but have witneſſes, and witneſſes that muſt agree, and they ask him what hee anſwereth to them: and all in publike, to ſhew that they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe ſlanders in corners, but dealt as men that would juſtify their proceedings, and ſtand to their doings. Yet for all theſe fair and colourable pretences, their Plot is to pronounce the ſentence of condemnation upon him.</p>

As violently are they carried into their riots, drunken mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, adulterous and ſilthy meetings, murtherous and revengeful plots, curſed and blaſphemous Oaths, rotten and poyſonful language, wicked and diabolical courſes, as the ſwine were hurried by the Devils into the lake. And if Devils were incarnate, and ſhould put on mens ſhapes, wee cannot deviſe how they could otherwiſe carry themſelves more to corrupt humane ſociety, and more to heap up their own and others damnation. And let the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates or Miniſters uſe means to reclaim, or (if that bee hopeleſs) to reſtrain and hinder their malice, Oh they are ſo far from giving up their courſes, as they rage and ſtorm ſo much the more, they will not bee ſo wronged, as bee at every mans command; they did ſwear, and will ſwear; they were drunk, and will bee drunk; and to juſtify any thing that they have wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, they will repeat it.</p>

Of how much ſtrength therefore may theſe be conceived in Kings and Princes, who have a ſea in compariſon of our drops? Which forbids us to marvel, when we ſee the moſt excellent Kings, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> altogether impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to withſtand the waves of temptation.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the Devil keeps not only in the Country, but in the Court, and his malice againſt us, ſtirreth up his rage againſt our chief Rulers: as when the Devil had a malice to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee ſet upon <hi>David</hi> to number the people. Which one conſideration ſhould ſtir us daily in our prayers to bee mindful of our Prince and Governours, that as our provocations bring tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them, ſo our petitions for them may help them through all.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Such as are in any eminency or place above others, muſt be ſo much the more watchful; and let this meditation bee as an antidote to expel the poyſon, ſwelling, and inflammation of pride, that the higher thy hill is, the more is Satans malice and plots againſt thee. If a man ſtand upon the top, or any part of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that is, be a Teacher in the Church, hee muſt know that he is a light ſet upon an hill or mountain, all eyes are upon him; and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40284:100"/> therefore <hi>Satan</hi> that <hi>ſtood at</hi> Jehoſhuahs <hi>right hand,</hi> will not bee far from him: let him make right ſteps to his feet, leſt hee treading awry, many be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the way. Let ſuch as are eminent in profeſſion above others, bee more watchful than others: Satan is more buſy with thee becauſe thou ſhalt open many mouthes againſt thy profeſſion, and hee will wound many through thy ſides, hee will make many aſhamed becauſe of thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thee hee will make Gods enemies to <hi>blaspheme,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. Thy ſlip or fall ſhall make all <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Askelon</hi> ring of all thy profeſſion; for they are all alike; never a good one of them all, &amp;c. Such as are carried into the mountain of earthly proſperity, muſt labour for more ſtrength and wachful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, than if they were in a lower eſtate: elſe Satan will make this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the dead ſea, in which no grace can live.

We know that the Moon being at full is furtheſt from the Sun, and commonly fulneſs and abundance withdraw us from our Sun of righteouſneſs, whence wee have all influence of light and grace.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Let this point work contentment in our hearts, and cauſe us to prize a mean and comfortable eſtate, wiſhing no mountains but that holy mountain of God, where wee ſhall bee free from all gun-ſhot, and ſafe from all temptation. Here is an holy ambition to affect and aſpire to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wherein wee ſhall reign as Kings. In the mean time, if wee deſire ſuperiority or command, let us labour to overcome ſin, the Devil, our ſelves, and our Luſts, let us depoſe them from reigning in our mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And if at any time we begin to admite our ſelves and others, for outward proſperity and greatneſſe in the World, let us turn our eyes another way, and eſteem Gods Wiſdome and fear above all outward happineſs. This was the Wiſdome of <hi>Solomon,</hi> with which God was ſo well pleaſed, that having it in his choice to ask Riches, or long Life or Victory, hee ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Wiſdome</hi> before them all, and God gave him b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> that and them. Let this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee our wiſdome, to affect goodneſs not greatneſs, this brings Satan upon us, that drives him away from us.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing in the preparation, is the ſight repreſented, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things: I what was the ſight, <hi>All the Kingdomes of the World, and the glory of them.</hi> 2 How Satan repreſented them, <hi>hee ſhewed him.</hi> 3 How long this ſight laſted, <hi>in a moment,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. The ſight was <hi>all the Kingdomes of the earth,</hi> both the Kingdomes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Majeſty, Beauty, Glory, and order of them; yea, their wealth, and whatſoever was in them, by which the minde of our Saviour might bee rapt into the admiration of them, and after to deſire them. For the end of his temptation is Idolatry, and his means is covetouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But were there not many ſorrows, vexations, and tumults in the World? why doth Satan ſhew none of theſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 His policy and ſubtilty would not make ſhow of any thing, which would hinder his temptation, but did all to further it. His ſcope was to bring Chriſt into love with the World, and for this purpoſe hee muſt make it as lovely as hee can, as a cunning fiſher muſt hide the hook, and ſhew nothing but the bait. 2 Hee knew that by this very trick hee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> to whom hee ſhewed nothing but the fair ſide of the Apple, and benefit and bettering of their eſtate, how by eating of it they ſhould bee as Gods; but hid all the inconvenience, that it was a breach of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40284:100"/> Gods Commandement, and that the iſſue was death. And ſo he goes about to circumvent the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. The manner of this ſight, <hi>And ſhewed him</hi>] Some think in a Map. But hee needed not have carried him into a Mountain for that. Neither in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, illuding his minde and phantaſy; becauſe this hee might have done in the Wilderneſſe, or on the Pinacle, if it could agree ſo well to the perfection of Chriſts mind. But I take it, hee offered the images and repreſentations of them all ſenſibly and actually, after a wonderful and ſtrange manner, making their Images to appear to his ſenſes. And if a man by his Art can repreſent to the ſenſes in a glaſs, any perſon or thing ſo lively, by which hee that ſees not the thing it ſelf, diſcerneth a notable image of it; how much more may wee think, that Satan by his Art and Cunning can repreſent to the ſenſe, the Images of things which are not indeed preſent? A lively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation whereof appeareth in his lumber, I mean Sorcerers and Juglers, who by the Devils help moſt cunningly delude the ſenſes. But Chriſt did indeed ſee the Images, and moſt glorious repreſentations of the World, and the Kingdomes of it: the which that hee might think to bee the things themſelves, and the better to perſwade him that hee ſaw the things indeed, hee ſet him on an exceeding high mountain; notwithſtanding hee knew, that the higheſt mountain of the World could manifeſt but a ſmall part of the whole; and if it could, yet the ſtrongeſt eye of man could reach but a little way, and were not able, at leaſt in ſo ſmall a time, to diſtinguiſh the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The time how long this ſight laſted; <hi>In a moment,</hi>

                        </gap>. In accurate conſideration, a moment is the fortieth part of an hour, for a point of time is a quarter of an hour, and a moment of time is the tenth part of a point of time. But I think wee are not to take the word ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which here noteth a very ſhort time, much ſhorter than the fortieth part of an hour: and with <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> I think it to bee the ſame with that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, <hi>in the twinkling of an eye,</hi> which is indeed no time, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning rather of time, ſeeing there is no diſtinction between time paſt, and time to come. Howſoever, wee muſt take it for a very ſhort ſpace of time, and that the ſight was gone before Chriſt could well conſider of it. For ſo the like phraſe is uſed concerning <hi>Sodome,</hi> that it was deſtroyed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the Sun roſe very fair, and before ever they could conſider of ſuch a ſtorm, the Lord ſhowred down fire and brimſtone.</p>
                     <p>Now the reaſon why the Devil uſed ſuch a ſpeedy and quick repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was, to raviſh Chriſt ſuddenly, and ſtir up his affections by the abſence of it, to deſire to ſee it again: dealing with Chriſt as we with our little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; when wee would make them earneſtly deſire a thing, wee let them ſee it, and hide it again, give it them into their hands, and ſuddenly take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way again. So did Satan. Secondly, Satan might have another trick in it, to diſturb the minde of our Saviour: for as a ſuddain flaſh or light doth dazle the eyes of the body, ſo doth a ſuddain flaſh or ſight of this or that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, eaſily dazle the eyes of the minde, and inſtead of pleaſure with it, at leaſt it brings ſome trouble and perturbation. However, he thought it would fit and bring on his temptation. Thirdly, ſhadows will abide no looking on, no examining, and therefore the Devil is ſo quick in taking them in.</p>
                     <p>Doct. 1 <hi>It is an old practice of the Devil, to let death into the ſoul, by the window of the ſenſes, and especially by the ſight:</hi> for here hee would overcome Chriſt by the ſight of the World, and the glory of it. Thus hee had gained <hi>Eve</hi> to ſin by the ſight of the apple, which was beautiful to the eye: by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhee ſhould bee as God, if ſhe did taſte it: by touching, taſting, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40284:101"/> pleaſing all her ſenſes with it. The ſons of God ſaw the daughters of men that they were fair, and took them to them for wives: which was the cauſe of the deluge. <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaw the vineyard of <hi>Naboth</hi> lye ſo conveniently to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means, as he muſt needs compaſs it by murther.</p>

                        </label> 1 The Senſes are the near ſervants of the Soul: if Satan can make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſty, he knows he can by them eaſily robb the ſoul, yea and ſlay it. For ſenſes work affections, and affections blind judgement. <hi>David</hi> ſees <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> preſently affects her, his violent affection blinds his judgement, he muſt have her company though it coſt <hi>Uriahs</hi> life. I ſaw (ſaid <hi>Achan</hi>) among the ſpoyl a goodly <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> garment, and two hundred ſheckels of ſilver, and a wedge of gold of fifty ſhekels; and I coveted them, and took them, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.21. How was <hi>Adam</hi> otherwiſe deceived by <hi>Eve,</hi> but firſt in his affection, and then in his judgement?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 As Satan lays his baits in all the Senſes to ſteal the heart, ſo eſpecially in the eyes, dealing as the Chapman that would vent his wares, he lays it forth on the ſtall that men may ſee it, and oftentimes the very ſight of it, without further offer, draws on the buyer to a bargain. He knows he loſeth not all, if he gain but an unlawful look: becauſe there is ſin begun, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Senſe is to the Soul as a door to the houſe: A man that would come in, or ſend any thing into an houſe, muſt goe in and ſend it in by the door. Even ſo, although the Devil by his ſpiritual nature, can and doth apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to our ſpirits without our ſenſes, yet other tempters cannot reach the ſoul ſo immediately. <hi>Eve</hi> could not work <hi>Adams</hi> heart directly, but by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes of hearing, and ſeeing eſpecially ſent in the temptation. Poyſons cannot reach the heart, unleſs by the ſenſes they bee drawn in. So wicked Mates cannot convey their corruption one into another, but by the outward ſenſes; hearing their wicked and incentive ſpeeches, and ſeeing their grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and infecting actions. But beſides this, ſo full of malice is our ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaty, that he would not only immediately take up our hearts, but fill up all our ſenſes, and by them continually ſendeth in burning luſts, and by the ſame door covetous deſires, and by the ſame ambitious and aſpiring thoughts, and by the ſame revengeful intentions, and ſuch like, till the houſe be full of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Satan knows that God hath appointed the ſenſes for the good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort both of body and ſoul, eſpecially the ſight and hearing to bee the ſenſes of Diſcipline, to furniſh the mind with knowledge of God, with <hi>faith</hi> which is by hearing, with hope of his gracious promiſes, with heavenly meditations, and contemplation of his great Works which our eyes behold. Now Satan would croſs all this gracious conſtitution of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make the lights of the body, be means to blind the mind: he would fill up the ſenſes, and take them up with ſuch objects, as ſhall not only corrupt the heart, but keep out thoſe means of grace, which the Lord would by them convey into the heart: ſo that the ſoul ſhould be further poyſoned by the ſame means, which the Lord hath prepared as an Antidote, by which natural poyſon and corruption ſhould be expelled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This doctrine enjoyneth a diligent cuſtody of the ſenſes. A good Houſholder ſuſpecting Theeves and Robbers, will bee ſure to keep his doors and windows faſt. And we knowing that our ſenſes are the doors and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of our ſouls, muſt look to theſe doors, lock them, barre them, bolt them faſt, that the Devil enter not this way. True it is, that the inſide muſt firſt be made clean: for out of the heart proceeds <hi>an evil eye,</hi> Mark 7.22. But whoſoever is reſolved to keep his heart in any rightneſs, muſt think it his next care to ſhut out, and keep out whatſoever might be let in, to decline it and turn it from God again. What made the holy Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.37. pray ſo
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40284:101"/> earneſtly, that <hi>God would turn his eyes from beholding vanity,</hi> but that hee knew, that even a good heart (ſuch as his was) could never hold out, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the outward ſenſes, eſpecially the eyes, which by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> are there put for the reſt (both becauſe they are ſpecial factors of the ſoul, and becauſe of the multitude of their objects, and in regard of the quickneſs of ſight above all the reſt of the ſenſes laid together) were well ſafe-guarded? Can the heart or Market-place of a Town or City be ſafe from the ſiege of the enemy, if the Gates be caſt open, or the Wall demoliſhed, or the Ramparts bared of their ſence and munition? Why did <hi>Job</hi> make ſuch covenants with his eyes, but that he knew that without ſuch a ſence every object would be as a ſnare to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap his ſoul? <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. Nay, let an heart never ſo ſeaſoned with grace, ſuffer the ſenſes to leak, the ſoul is in danger of ſhipwrack. Was there ever heart of ordinary man or woman more innocent, or more filled with grace, than <hi>Eves</hi> in her innocency? And yet when as Satan let upon her ſenſes, he ſent in by them ſuch poyſon, as wrought death unto all her poſterity.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, how can we place our ſenſes better, than upon him who is the moſt pleaſant and durable object? To ſee God in Chriſt reconciled, to hear and know him become our Father, is ſo raviſhing a ſight, as the Saints have runne through fire and water to apprehend it.

I would ask the moſt carnal man that is, whether this in ſound judgement bee not a better object for our ſenſes, than Bowls, or Tables, and fitter for all times, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God made our ſenſes, to profit our ſelves by his Creatures, that by them we might glorifie him their Creator, and not by them corrupt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare our ſelves. Iſa. 40.26. <hi>Lift up your eyes aloft, and behold who created all theſe things.</hi> This uſe <hi>David</hi> maketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>When I ſee the heavens, the earth, and the works of thy hands, then ſaid I, Lord what is man that thou art ſo mindful of him?</hi> and concludes the Pſalm thus, <hi>How excellent is thy name
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40284:102"/> through all the World?</hi> And why? 1 The inviſible things of God, his Power, and Divinity, and Eternity, were made viſible to the very Gentiles by <hi>things created, Rom.</hi> 1.20. And ſhall wee either not look on them, or ſo look upon them as they to make us inexcuſable? ſhall wee onely injoy the natural uſe, and no ſpiritual or Divine uſe from them? 2 Conſider that God, for this purpoſe, hath made the Countenance of man, not as the Beaſts groveling on the Earth, but erected unto Heaven: and he hath made the eye of man not as the Beaſts, but (as <hi>Anntomiſts</hi> obſerve) hath given it one muſcle which they want, whereby hee can turn his eye directly upwards with admirable quickneſs, that it ſhould not ſo fix it ſelf upon any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as the Covetous eye doth, but by occaſion of things below turn it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to their Creator. Yea, hee hath compaſſed our eyes with brows, and lids, and fences from duſt and earth, that though wee look ſometimes on the earth, yet the leaſt duſt or earth ſhould not get into them. 3 Let us labour to uſe our ſenſes in beholding Gods works, as they in <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. that ſaw the works of Chriſt of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Many beleeved in the name of Christ, ſeeing the works that he did.</hi> So let the works which wee ſee God hath done, bee at leaſt inducements to beleeve him ſo much the more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God made our ſenſes in reſpect of our brethren, both to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them, and our ſelves by them. 1 Our eyes to behold their miſery, to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty them, to releeve them. Turn not thine eyes from thine own fleſh. Herein the unmerciful Prieſt and Levite were condemned by the pitiful <hi>Samaritan.</hi> Our ears to hear the cry of the poor, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Hee that turns his ear from the cry of the poor, himſelf ſhallery and not bee heard.</hi> Numbers never make this uſe of their ears: but God hath a deaf ear for them. 2 Our eyes to ſee the good example of our brethren, to imitate them, to glorify God for them. Our ears to hear their Godly Counſels, Admonitions, Reproofs, and ſo bee bettered by them. 3 Our eyes to ſee and conſider their danger, to pull them out of their infirmities, the fire, and to caſt out the more of their eyes. Our ears to hear what is fit to bee ſpoken of them, to defend their good names if they bee traduced. For God hath given us two ears, not raſhly to receive every information, but to reſerve one for the party, leſt hee be condemned unheard, unconvinced.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fiftly,</hi> and Laſtly, God made our ſenſes in reſpect of ourſelves, not only to bee faithful keepers of the body, but diligent factors and agents for our own ſouls: as 1 That our eyes ſhould ever bee looking homewards, and to the end of our way, as quick and expedite travellors, and not fix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon everything wee ſee here below. This is done by heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. 2 Our ears ſhould bee bored to the perpetual ſervice and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of our God, as our Lord himſelf was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>Thou haſt bored mine ear:</hi> alluding to that Ceremony in the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.6. <hi>If a ſervant would not part from his Maſter, his ear muſt bee bored and nailed to the Poſt of the houſe,</hi> and thus hee became a perpetual Servant, hee was nailed and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that houſe and ſervice; So wee muſt <hi>yeeld an obedient ear,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it, unto the Counſels, Will, and Commandement of our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 Our eyes were made to bee Conduits of tears, for our own ſin and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for the ſin and wretchedneſſe of other men. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.136. Davids <hi>eyes guſhed out rivers of tears, becauſe men keep not the word:</hi> how wept hee then for his own ſins, that wept ſo for others? Good <hi>Lot</hi> his righteous ſoul was vexed in hearing and ſeeing the unclean converſation of the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Thus ſhould our ſenſes bee ſo far from conceiving pleaſure in ſinful obects, as theſe muſt bee the continual grief of our ſouls. And can wee indeed look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, and not ſee ſomething which is a brand of our ſin? or can wee behold any Creature, and not ſee ſome expreſs Prints and marks of our ſin,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40284:103"/> and vanity upon it? Surely this one meditation would be effectual to keep us from caſting our eyes upon unlawful objects, and ſo from making our ſelves a prey to the Devil.</p>

Such as have in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Popiſh Pictures and Images, which are alluring harlots, corrupters of the heart, which is an opening of the door to the Devil, a ſign of a man willing to bee ſeduced. Experience ſhews, that when a man is in love with ſuch Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, hee eaſily falls out with Gods Image in himſelf, and Gods Children. 2 Such as delight in laſcivious Pictures, and filthy portraytours of naked men or women, in whole, or ſuch parts as may ſtir the corruption of the heart, which ſhould bee beaten down by all means. Wee need bring no Oyle to this flame. Yet the Devil hath gotten ſuch pictures in requeſt in this wanton age, wherein every thing is almoſt proportional. 3 Such are far from this watch of their ſenſes, as ſo attire and diſguiſe themſelves, or lay open their nakedneſs to inſnare the ſenſes of others. Let them not ſay, they think no hurt in it, unleſs they can bee ſure that no other think hurt by it. 4 Such as like the Images have ears and hear not, eyes and ſee not; care not to hear the Word or read it, never taſte Gods goodneſs in it, neither doth the breath of heavenly life ever paſs through their noſes. 5 Such as frequent wicked company, and delight in the ungracious actions and ſpeeches, that they hear and ſee, or can digeſt them without reproof or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like manifeſted. The Devil hath a thorow-fare among ſuch companies, who are conſpired againſt God and goodneſs. Add unto theſe ſuch as read or have in their houſes, Laſcivious and wanton books, teachers of lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Adde alſo Stage-Players and their beholders, that caſt open all gates and walls to the Devil. 6 The Covetous eye, whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ecc.</hi> 4.4. his eye is not ſatisfied with Riches, neither doth hee ſay, <hi>For whom do I thus labour?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In that Satan would draw Chriſt to the love of the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by makes no doubt but to inſnare and caſt him down, wee learn; that,</p>

                     <p>Where by the <hi>World,</hi> I underſtand not the goodly Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in the frame of the Heavens and Earth, which wee muſt love and admire: but all the Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, Profits, and Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, without God, or before God: as when men are willing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Slaves to Worldly Deſires and Corruptions. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. <hi>The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of money, is the root of all evil,</hi> a fruitful mother of much miſchief. There is no ſin ſo impious, ſo unnatural and barbarous, that a man in love with the Profits of the World will ſtick at.

                     <p n="3">3 The love of the World ſpoiles us of our armour and ſtrength, by which wee ſhould bee fenced from Satans ſubtleties. For, 1 Whereas our chief fence is in Gods Word, it <hi>Firſt</hi> intercepteth the Word, and eſtrangeth the heart from it, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>They ſit before thee, and hear thy words, but their hearts go after their covetouſneſſe: Secondly,</hi> it choaketh the Word, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as ſeed caſt among Thorns, which choak it preſently: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it ſcorns the Word, as may appear, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.14. <hi>Theſe things heard the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees which were Covetous, and mocked.</hi> Now is not ſuch an one eaſily ſnared by the Devil, who is thus diſ-affected to Gods Word? Is not hee eaſily bound, that wants, yea, ſcorns his weapons? 2 The love of the World, whether the Pleaſures, Profits, or Glory of it, as a Theef, ſteals and robs our graces, which are another chief part of our ſtrength. Good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a little tickled with vain-glory, made himſelf and his Land a prey and ſpoil to the Enemy. Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> loved too much the unlawful pleaſures of the World, and how did it rob him of his Wiſdome? The Diſciples, while yet Chriſt was with them, were ſtirred with love and debate for ſuperiority and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which did much hinder them, and took up their thoughts, when they might have attended to better things. How many for love of the World and Preferment, fall from their firſt love, abate their zeal, become cold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as the times are?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The love of the World, where it is rooted, delivers a man ſo far into the hands of Satan, as hee eaſily falls from all ſhew of goodneſs, and dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revolts from all the goodneſs that ſeemed to bee in him. The young man that came to Chriſt with many good ſhews and deſires, hearing of ſelling all, and giving to the poor, goeth away heavily, and wee hear no more of him. <hi>Demas,</hi> once a Companion of <hi>Paul,</hi> but eaſily forſook the truth, when hee embraced the preſent World. <hi>Judas</hi> an Example, almoſt without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a Diſciple at Chriſts elbow, indued with excellent gifts Apoſtolical, of Doctrin, of Miracles, &amp;c. having his heart glewed to the World, for a trifle fell from his place, from all the affection hee had ſembled to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, from the ſociety of his fellow Diſciples, <hi>and ſtood with them that betrayed him.</hi>

Hee is a bad Tenant; the more land he holds, the leſs homage hee doth unto God. And as for works of Mercy, hee will not part with his crums, like the rich man in the Goſpel. And as hee lives altogether unprofitable to others, ſo to himſelf; hee hath no care of his ſalvation: <hi>Thou fool, This night ſhall they take away thy ſoul.</hi> 2 As hee hath no power to do any good for God or man, ſo he will ſuffer nothing. A man loving the World, flies affliction for Chriſt: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21. when
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40284:104"/> the Sun riſeth, hee withers: when perſecution comes, hee is offended, and falls away to the hinderance of many. They that minde <hi>earthly things, are enemies to the croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.19.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 Conſider what cauſe there is in the World to love it: 1 In reſpect of God; it is contrary to his nature: Hee is Holy, Pure, Righteous; the World lieth in unrighteouſneſs.

It teacheth to Lye, Swear, Curſe, Slander, and Circumvent. Hee commands all fruits of the Spirit; it injoyns all the works of the fleſh. Hee commands to give our goods to the Needy, it wills us to get our Neighbours. 2 In reſpect of it ſelf: it is changeable, variable, inconſtant: and wilt thou affect that which thou canſt not hold or injoy? 3 In reſpect of thy ſelf: is it not madneſs, exceſſively to love that which doth thee ſo much harm, pricks as thornes, and pierceth with ſo many ſorrows, croſſes, loſſes, perſecutions? which if thou beeſt good, will fight againſt thee, and purſue thee with mortal hatred, and only ſlayeth thoſe which reſiſt it not.</p>

This is the common error, that men look altogether upon the Beauty, Glory, and fair ſide of the World, and wealth of it; but never look upon the inconveniences of them, and how ſtrong they are to pull us away from God, or how apt to make us a ſpoil to Satan: which one conſideration would ſomewhat abate our heat, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards them. How ambitiouſly do many affect promotion and great
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40284:104"/> places, not conſidering in what ſlippery places their feet are ſet? How ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly doe they deſire wealth, as though it had no power to draw the heart from God, and the wealth of Heaven? How unſatiably doe they purſue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not conſidering how the Devil inſnares them, and makes them <hi>lovers of pleaſure, more than lovers of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Surely were men acquainted with their own hearts, they would not ſuffer them ſo to rove in theſe deſires. Oh, ſaith one, if I were a rich man, how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral would I be to the poor? But alas, he knows not what ſpirit he is of: the Devil would make no doubt to change his mind, it his ſtate were changed, and make of this liberal man either a Prodigal, or an Uſurer, or an Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and doe much more miſchief than he can in his low eſtate. Oh, ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, were I in high place, I would right wrongs, and ſet things in order. But ſo ſaid <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and yet who did more wrong than he, deflouring his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Concubines, and depoſing (if he could) his father himſelf? And ſuch right would many doe, if they were in higher place. All which is an argument how open we lye to Satan in ſuch eſtates.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this point, obſerve theſe few rules: 1 Put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and care not to fulfil the fleſh. 2 Vſe the world, as not uſing it,

                        <hi>All theſe]</hi> here is no pinching, nor parting of the matter: but 1 Chriſt ſhall be an abſolute Monarch, none ſhall ſhare with him: There is the extent of the profer, he will part with <hi>all.</hi> 2 The quality of it; All <hi>theſe,</hi> the glory, beauty, wealth, and <hi>all</hi> that can be deſired in the world: <hi>all</hi> that he ſaw, and nothing elſe: he would give him unmixed and unblended glory and honour, without ſorrow, trouble, ſhame, or vexation: for he ſaw none of them. 3 <hi>I will give thee:</hi> but he will not barter or ſell theſe ſo dear to Chriſt as he would to another, but he will deal kindly with him, he will as good as give them to him, if he will but make a legge, and thank him for them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Note here the nature of all the Devils promiſes: <hi>they ſeem to be liberal and very fair, whereas indeed they are miſerably foul and deceitful.</hi> Who could expect more frank and plain dealing than is here pretended? but look a little nearer, we ſhall ſee it vaniſhing into nothing but deceit and miſchief. For 1. What is this great <hi>all</hi> that he makes profer of? A great catch, juſt nothing, but ſhadows and repreſentations of things, in themſelves nothing at all but the ſhow he had made. 2 As this great <hi>all</hi> was but a ſhow, ſo it was but for a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40284:105"/> moment: for ſhadows cannot continue: and what were Chriſt the better if he had been put in poſſeſſion of the things themſelves, if they ſo ſuddenly vaniſh away before he can give a ſight of them? 3 His beſt and largeſt promiſes here are but in the tranſitory Kingdoms of this life, which all paſs away as a ſhadow, ſo as if he had offered and could have performed the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it had been no great matter: he never offers and makes good any ſound grace, or the things of Gods Kingdom, which are things only worth harkning after. 4 Will he give all the Kingdoms, and all the glory of them to Chriſt alone? why, what righteouſneſs or juſtice could be herein? Will he rob and ſpoyl all other Kings, and Rulers in the world, of their right and ſoveraignty, which God had inveſted them in, and this all at once, and in a moment? 5 Whereas he pretends a gilt, he intends a dear bargain: and offering nothing but pure and unmixed glory, he would rob Chriſt our Head and all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at once of all joy and happineſs both external and eternal. Of this kind are all his promiſes: he promiſed to <hi>Eve</hi> Deity; but it proved mortality and miſery: he promiſed <hi>Cain</hi> reſpect and love, if he could make <hi>Abel</hi> out of the way; but it proved the caſting of himſelf out from the face of God, and his Fathers family.</p>

                        </gap>s enmity and hatred of God, and mans ſalvation, makes him large in his promiſes: he knows how ſlily temptations on the right hand ſteal into the heart, and that no enemy is ſo dangerous as he that comes in pretence of kindneſs. When he ſeeks to draw man to Hell with him, he takes on him to teach him how to become a God. When Chriſt was to ſuffer hee would have him to ſpare himſelf, to hinder mans ſalvation: he will offer Kingdoms, <hi>all</hi> Kingdoms, with <hi>all</hi> the wealth and pleaſure of them. Satan herein deals as <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſons with the <hi>Sichemites:</hi> they made very fair promiſes, that if they would be circumciſed, they would give their Daughters, and take their Daughters, and dwell together as one people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.16. <hi>But they talked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully,</hi> verſ. 13. intending only revenge upon them, as they did when the Males were ſore by means of their circumciſing. Satan can promiſe a Victory to <hi>Ahab,</hi> but it is to chaſe him before his enemy to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 He knows mans credulity and folly, who is eaſily taken with fair words which make fools fain, their eyes being wholly upon things before them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, howſoever our bleſſed Lord here was fenced, that the leaſt inordinate affection could not faſten upon him, although he had all the objects in the world to move him, yet he commonly findes men and women fitted for his turn, doating upon the world, and needs no ſuch large offers as here are made to Chriſt, but for leſs commodity and glory than that in one Kingdom, will fall down and worſhip him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Satan is ſo much the larger in his promiſes, to imitate God, whom hee ſees encouraging his ſervants by making covenant with them, and promiſing them all the good things of this life and that to come, as to <hi>Abraham, All that thou ſeeſt I will give thee.</hi> Now to draw men from Gods Covenant, if it were poſſible, and to diſgrace the ſame, Satan ſeeks to get men in league with him, by larger promiſes of the world than ever God made to one man, becauſe that carrieth their whole deſires: and as God for the ratifying of his Covenant hath appointed Sacraments and Seals, ſo the Devil hath certain words, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures characters, ceremonies, and charms for the confirmation of his league with them, and their faith in that league.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Hence obſerve a difference between Gods promiſes and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:40284:105"/>1 They differ in the matter. Satan profers earthly ſhadows, earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, things that glance through the ſenſe, worldly things which may bee perceived, and thruſt into the eye and ſenſes all at once, the beſt of which is but a phantaſie; as <hi>Paul</hi> calls the great pomp of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Bernice,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 25.23</note> things of a moment for continuance, that laſt as long as the fulneſs of the Moon, ſcarce ſeen but vaniſhing. But the matter of Gods promiſes is the Kingdom, not of Earth, but of Heaven, and the glory thereof, to which all earthly things are but appendices: things which cannot be ſhadowed: for the eye cannot ſee, nor the ear hear, <hi>neither can it enter into the heart of an earthly man, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. The great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are matters of faith, not of ſenſe; and for continuance, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth a Kingdom unſhaken, eternal, reſerved in the heavens; a glory not withering or fading, unlike the glory of fleſh: of all which the Prophet ſaith, it is <hi>like the flower of the field,</hi> Iſa. 40.6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They differ in the ſcope and aime of them. Gods promiſes all ſerve to provoke and encourage men to lay hold upon the Covenant of life, to draw men nearer God in faith and obedience: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Seeing wee have theſe precious promiſes, let us clenſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and grow up unto full holineſs in the fear of God. But Satans promiſes tend to fix men in the world, as here hee would make Chriſt the greateſt worldling in it, to with-draw men from God and their Covenant with him, to pull them from the ſervice of the God of Heaven, to worſhip himſelf, or ſerve their luſts, or embrace the world, or bow to any thing but the true God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 They differ in the accompliſhment, God is ever as good or better than his word: <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>God who cannot lye hath promiſed.</hi> To <hi>David</hi> (as <hi>Nathan</hi> witneſſeth in his reproof, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.8.) he gave his Lords houſe, his Lords Wives, his Lords Kingdom, and if that had been little, he would have given him more. To <hi>Salomon</hi> he promiſed long life, or wealth, or wiſdome, and in the accompliſhment he gives him both life, and wealth, and wiſdom. But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is never ſo good as his word, but a Lier in all his promiſes. For, 1 Hee wants power to perform, when he promiſeth that which is none of his, as <hi>the Kingdoms of the world.</hi> Or, 2 He wants purpoſe and will to perform his promiſe: For, had he a purpoſe and mind to have given Chriſt the Kingdoms of the world, if he had had power? Doth not he envie to every man the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any creature of God? Can hee willingly afford a good man a good moment? And did not he more malign Chriſts good and comfort than all other, becauſe he exceeded all other in grace and Gods Image? Or, 3 Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath power and purpoſe to be an honeſt Devil of his word, it is with a farre more miſchievous purpoſe: as here, if hee could have given the whole world, he would for Chriſts overthrow: for what cares he for the world, or what uſe can he make of it, but to make it a bait and train to catch man by it into his own deſtruction. The ground hereof is this; As every promiſe of God is a teſtimony of his love, ſo every promiſe of Satan is a token of his malice.</p>
                     <p>An example of the Devils faithfulneſs we have in our own Chronicles: In the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, when the <hi>Welch-men</hi> rebelled, their Captain reſorted to a Conjurer for counſel, whether he ſhould goe on in the intended warre againſt the King, or no: yes (ſaid the Devil) goe on in thy purpoſe; for thou ſhalt ride through Cheap-ſide with a Crown on thy head: and ſo he did indeed, but it was cut off, and he was carried in triumph as a prey to the King.</p>
                     <p>This may juſtly reprove and ſhame many profeſſed Chriſtians, that will ſcarce give Gods promiſes of grace and life the hearing, though they are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Chriſt, in whom they are all <hi>yea, and amen,</hi> flowing from his love, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40284:106"/> tending to our eternal happineſs with himſelf. Many will not bee brought to hear them; many hardly when they have nothing elſe to do; and many hear them as things not concerning themſelves; for then would they take more delight in them. But if Satan promiſe any earthly Kingdome or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, hee hath our ears, our hearts at command, all our ſpeech runs upon the World, our deſires and hopes are for earth and earthly things: and being thus earthly-minded, how expoſe wee our ſelves to Satans aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and offer our ſelves to bee won by his moſt treacherous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This teacheth us what to think of that Doctrin and Religion, that teacheth men to be Promiſe-breakers: what may we think of it, but to bee a treacherous, unfaithful, Diabolical Religion? But ſuch is the Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as wee may eaſily ſee in two or three inſtances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In that Article of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> That <hi>Faith is not to bee kept with Hereticks,</hi> that is, <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> and ſo brake promiſe with <hi>John Hus,</hi> who had not the Emperours onely, but the Popes ſafe-conduct. Againſt the Examples of good <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who kept Promiſe (though raſhly made) with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and with the Harlot of <hi>Jericho;</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> who kept Truth and Promiſe with <hi>Shimei,</hi> a ſeditious and curſing wretched Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth by the Doctrin of Equivocation, to break the Promiſe of a lawful Oath, before a lawful Magiſtrate, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the lawfulneſs thereof. But the Scripture condemneth a double heart, and the deceitful Tongue: and proclaimeth <hi>woe againſt them that truſt in lying words,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In lib de fide cum haretic is ſervanda.</note> 
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.8. and that make falſhood their refuge. Yea, <hi>Molanus,</hi> a great and learned Papiſt, concludes, <hi>ſyncerè faedera &amp; juramenta ſunt intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> all leagues, and eſpecially Oathes, are ſincerely to bee underſtood, and condemns plainly ſuch mockeries and dalliance with Promiſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts, by one or two inſtances; as of him that made truce with his enemy for thirty daies, and waſted his Enemies Countrey and Camps only in the night: and of <hi>Aurelianus</hi> the Emperour, who comming afore a Town <hi>Tijana,</hi> and finding the Gates ſhut, to animate his Souldiers, with great anger ſaid, I will not leave a Dog in the Town: they hoping for the ſpoil, beeſtirred themſelves to Ranſack the Town; but being won, hee would not give them leave to ſpoil it, but bad them leave never a Dog in it, and let the goods alone. This was but a dalliance, condemned by the Papiſt himſelf; and yet had more colour of truth than Popiſh Equivocation can have.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Romiſh Church teacheth men to break Promiſes and Oaths with lawful and Chriſtian Princes, exempting ſubjects from obedience, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Swords, Dags, Daggers, Powder, and all deadly plots into their heads, and hands, againſt the Lords anointed. A treacherous and Devilliſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Wee ſee alſo what houſe treacherous and deceitful perſons deſcend of, ſuch as care not how much they promiſe, and how little they perform, men moſt unlike unto God, and reſembling their Father the Devil, who is moſt laviſh and prodigal in his promiſes, when hee knows hee hath neither power nor purpoſe to perform; men of great tongues, which ſwell as moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, but of little hands, not performing mole-hills. Of theſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.14. <hi>Hee that glorieth of a falſe gift</hi> (that is, ſpeaketh of great things that hee will do for his Neighbour, but failes in the accompliſhment) <hi>is like a cloud and wind without rain.</hi> A Cloud ſeems to offer and promiſe Rain, but the winde takes it away, and fruſtrates a mans expectations. And the ſame is true of all windy Promiſes. Which wee muſt carefully avoid, and uſe theſe rules againſt ſlipperineſs in promiſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 If a man would bee like God, <hi>who cannot</hi> lye in his promiſes, hee muſt
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40284:106"/> ſtrive againſt it. But Satan is a Lyar from the beginning, and the Father of Lyes and Lyars. 2 Faithfulneſſe in contracts is the ſinew of humane ſociety, which Satan would have crackt, that hee may bring all to confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 3 The Heathens that were given up by God to a reprobate ſenſe, are branded with this mark, <hi>they are truce-breakers, Rom.</hi> 1.31. 4 It is a mark of a man in the ſtate of grace, who hath obtained remiſſion of ſins, that <hi>in his spirit is no guile, Pſal.</hi> 32.2. 5 A note of a man that ſhall dwell in Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heavenly mount, is this, <hi>hee speaks the truth from his heart,</hi> Pſal. 15.2. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.5. <hi>They onely ſhall ſtand on Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and ſing before the Throne, who have no guilt in their months.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eſpecially wee muſt bee careful of two promiſes, whereof God and the Congregation have been witneſſes: as 1 That of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which wee muſt have a ſpecial care to look unto: for, if wee fail in keeping touch with God, no marvail if wee fail with men. 2 That of <hi>Marriage,</hi> which the Prophet calls the <hi>Covenant of God,</hi> Mal. 2.14.</p>
                     <p>THE ſecond thing in this profer, is the reaſon annexed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.6. <hi>For it is delivered unto mee, and to whomſoever I will, I give it.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>The Devil, like a deſperate man, that is ſure in this bout to kill or bee kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, laies about him with all the skill and ſtrength hee hath, yea, hee is put to his ſhifts, ſo as no baſe or miſchievous deviſe comes amiſs, by which hee may either in fair combat, or cowardly attempts oppreſs his adverſary: and that which hee cannot do by ſtrength and power, hee will attempt by falſhood and lies; which hee heaps up here together moſt like himſelfe, <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lies that ſtood not in the truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here he challengeth the power and glory of the World to bee his, 1 In Poſſeſſion: 2 In diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Hee affirmeth it to bee his, but not directly, but indirectly: by Gift, <hi>It is delivered unto mee.</hi> But this is a moſt notorious lye: for <hi>the earth is the Lords, and all that therein is, the world, and all that dwell therein,</hi> Pſal. 24.1. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Behold, the Heaven of Heavens is the Lords thy God, and the earth, with all that therein is.</hi> And where read wee that ever hee committed theſe into the hand of the Devil?</p>
                     <p>Object. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.30. <hi>Hee is called the</hi> Prince of the World; <hi>therefore hee speaks true.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Hee is called the <hi>Prince of the World,</hi> not ſimply, but as it is corrupted: the Prince of this <hi>World,</hi> ſaith the Text; which world? <hi>this,</hi> which lyeth in malice and hoſtility againſt the Son of God, and the means of ſalvation. 2 Hee is not ſo a Prince, as having any right unto any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for hee cannot poſſeſs a Pig without leave: but by tyranny hee force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and commandeth as a Prince, the wicked World unto his obedience: for the World departing from God to his Adverſary, God in juſtice giveth Satan leave to prevail, and rule in the Sons of diſobedience. But will it follow, that becauſe hee ruleth in the world by ſin and death, being the prince of darkneſs, and having the power of death, therefore the parts of the world muſt needs bee his?</p>
                     <p>Object. 2 <hi>He is called the God of the World,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, not in reſpect of dominion over things created; but, 1 In reſpect of <hi>Corruption:</hi> for hee is the God of the evil in the world, the Author, Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader, and Nouriſher of all evil. 2 In reſpect of <hi>Seduction;</hi> for hee is bold to uſe all earthly things, which are made to Gods glory, to ſerve to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his temptations, and wicked mens luſts, and ſo to ſet up his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 3 In reſpect of <hi>opinion</hi> or eſtimation, becauſe the people of the world make the Devil their God. But this no more proves him to bee indeed the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40284:107"/> God of the World, than an Idol is proved to bee a true God, onely becauſe Idolaters ſo eſteem and make it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Devil affirms it to be in his diſpoſition, that <hi>hee may give it to whom hee will;</hi> which muſt needs bee another lye, becauſe it is not his in poſſeſſion: for nothing can give that which it hath not. 2 The Scriptures aſcribe this to God, as a perogative, and peculiar to him; <hi>By him Kings reign,</hi> Prov. 18.15. <hi>All powers that are, are ordained of God,</hi> Rom. 13.1. <hi>Hee maketh low, and hee maketh high. It is the moſt high that beareth rule over the Kingdomes of men,</hi> Dan. 4.22. <hi>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away,</hi> Job 1.21. 3 Another notorious lye is, that having them to diſpoſe of, hee will diſpoſe them to Chriſt, which is impoſſible, ſeeing Chriſt had them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſpoſed unto him, and had received them of his Father, ſo as he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could ſay, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.23. <hi>All things are given to mee of the Father:</hi> and, Joh. 3.35. <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hands.</hi> Therefore the Devil offering him the <hi>Kingdomes of the World,</hi> muſt needs lye. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ask of mee, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> If then Satan ſay, <hi>All this power will I give thee,</hi> it is a lye: <hi>for all power was given him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in earth of his Father, Matth.</hi> 28.18. So as in this profer hee belies the Fathers gift, and the Sons right, and derogates from the glory both of the Father and of the Son. 4 Another lye is his falſe boaſting, making himſelf Lord and <hi>Caſar</hi> of all, when hee hath not one foot of all hee ſpeaks of, like <hi>Solomons</hi> Bragadocio, <hi>There is one that maketh himſelf rich when he hath nothing,</hi> and when hee pretends his unjuſt uſurpation in the World, to bee a juſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and title to the World.</p>
                     <p>And thus wee have examined the ſubſtance and truth of this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and have found neither ſubſtance, truth, nor reaſon in it. Here note; that,</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>Bad cauſes muſt ever bee thruſt forward by bad means.</hi> Satan had a naughty matter in hand (as no better can beſeem him) namely, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Son of God, and all the ſalvation of mankinde; and the means by which hee would effect his purpoſe is ſuitable, lying, and falſhood, and boaſting: and hee is no changeling, never a true word comes out of his mouth. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. <hi>Jezabel</hi> had a wicked end to bring to paſſe, namely, the diſ-inheriting of <hi>Naboth,</hi> and ſetting <hi>Ahab</hi> into his poſſeſſion: and what means doth ſhee uſe but bribery, perjury, and murther of <hi>Naboth</hi> and his Children; and all this under a colour of Religion, and revenge of Gods cauſe, a faſt being proclaimed before it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. the Jews had as wicked a cauſe as ever was undertaken, <hi>viz.</hi> the oppreſſing and murther of the Son of God: and what means muſt they uſe? for <hi>what had the juſt man done?</hi> They muſt accuſe falſly, and ſuborn falſe witneſſes, and deprave his words, and make him ſpeak what they liſt. And what other means uſed they to falſify and ſuppreſs the truth and glory of his reſurrection? In this place, Satan aims to bring Chriſt to Idolatry, and the means is covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Peter</hi> had an ill cauſe in hand, to hinder Chriſt from being apprehended, and his means was bad, unwarrantable ſtriking.</p>

He promiſeth an whole world, when all ptoves but a ſhadow and image. He takes upon him to diſpoſe all things in the world, as though they were his, whereas we muſt goe to our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>the Father of lights,</hi> for every morſel of bread. Wherefore whoſoever would any way advantage himſelf by lying or deceiving, it is manifeſt the ſpirit of the Devil ruleth in him. And therefore <hi>caſt off lying</hi> as a ragge and relick of natural corruption, and <hi>ſpeak every man the truth to his neighbour,</hi> Epheſ. 4.25.</p>
                     <p>It is a received opinion in theſe days, that <hi>Qui neſcit diſſimulare, neſcit vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,</hi> No diſſembler, no man, and plain-dealing is a jewel, but he that uſeth it ſhall dye a beggar, and ſome men are too honeſt to thrive in the world: ſuch common ſpeeches argue the common breach of this Commandement. But know: 1. How farre are we degenerate from our fore-fathers: they lived ſimply by their hands according to Gods Ordinance: but now many live by their wits; whence it is that Trades are called Crafts and Myſteries, becauſe more live by craft and the ſin of their trade than the trade it ſelf. 2 The Lord is the avenger of all ſuch wrong by ſecret couſnage and lying: for he ſees that thou deceiveſt him that truſteth thee; and becauſe it is hidden from men, his own hand muſt revenge it. 3 What a ſhame is it and ſlander to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profeſſion, that men profeſſing ſalvation by Chriſt, ſhould ſo carry their trades as a man that comes to deal with them, muſt come ſo ſuſpitiouſly as if he were to fall into the hands of ſo many Theeves; and having dealt with them hath juſt cauſe to ſay, that he might find more juſt dealing with Turks and Infidels? Whereas if this vice <hi>were put off,</hi> a childe might traffique in the dark without deluſion.</p>
                     <p>The ſame of Boaſters, who brag of things they have not. As <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of the Leviathan of the Sea, ſo may we of the helliſh Leviathan, He is the King of all the ſons of Pride. As, 1 Many bear themſelves out in fine apparrel and bravery, when indeed nothing is their own, if their debts were paid. And if every Bird had his own feather, they might well goe naked. 2 Others, to raiſe themſelves, make no bones to lye and magnifie their eſtate, as the often experience of the world ſhews, that Widows and Widowers promiſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40284:108"/> great things of themſelves, and much wealth, whereas the greateſt wealth prove debts. 3 But if you will ſee the very natural portrayture of the father the Devil, if yee will hear his very voyce, look upon the Biſhop and Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He hath engroſſed all the Kingdoms of the earth into his own hands, ſaying, <hi>All theſe are mine,</hi> yet not directly, but <hi>in ordine ad Deum.</hi> 2 <hi>I give them to whom I will,</hi> I can ſet up and thruſt down, I can binde and looſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their obedience at my pleaſure. 3 I will give thee all theſe, <hi>if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me;</hi> if thou wilt be my vaſſal, and a ſound Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, let my Laws bind thy Conſcience, and perſecute with Fire and Sword theſe Hereticks, thus thou ſhalt hold thy Kingdom, elſe not. 4 But this is a ſmall thing to challenge the Kingdoms of the world, and therefore hee chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth to be Lord of Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory, to open and ſhut at his pleaſure, as his three Crowns imply. Here is a brag that puts down the Devil quite: never was the Devil overmatched in boaſting and lying but by the Pope his eldeſt ſon, that in him wee might have a plain demonſtration of Antichriſt, whom the Papiſts themſelves ſay muſt bee begotten by the Devil.</p>

                     <p>NOw follows the condition of Satans large and prodigal profer, which is the third thing conſiderable in the dart.

Wherein we ſee marvellous cunning and malice combined. 1 His cunning, in making it appear ſo ſmall a moat: for being a worſhip proper to God, as we ſee by comparing our Saviours anſwer with it, 1 He would make it in ſhow and appearance, but a bowing of the body, a ſmall thing, a geſture which God greatly regards not; as if hee had ſaid, as <hi>Bathſheba</hi> to her Son, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.10. <hi>I have a ſmall ſute unto thee, deny me not:</hi> which ſmall ſute if <hi>Salomon</hi> had hearkned unto, it had coſt him the loſs of his Kingdom.

                     <p n="2">2 His extream malice: in that, 1 He would rob and deprive God of his honour, which is due to him alone, and to no Creature elſe. 2 Hee would have it conferred upon himſelf, Gods greateſt enemy. 3 Hee would have none doe it him but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of Gods love, thus to wrong his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the more: whereas God expects no other of his enemies, <gap reason="foreign">

But Satans gifts proceed out of his endleſs hatred, and are wages of unrighteouſneſs. 2 Gods gifts are derived to us by good and warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means, diligence, labour, prayers: Satans, for the moſt part by wicked means. Gods conditions are profitable and ſafe: Satans hurtful and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, by the breach of ſome Commandement, by impiety or injuſtice. 3 Gods gifts are firſt beſtowed upon us, and then obedience is required as a teſtification of Thankfulneſs, not as merit: Satans are after our work, as a merit and wages of ſin; firſt <hi>fall down and worſhip mee,</hi> and then <hi>I will give thee all theſe things.</hi> 4 Gods gifts are in mercy, for our ſalvation and comfort, and incouragement in his ſervice: Satans, to draw us from his ſervice, and to drag us to deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Let this Doctrin make us afraid to receive any thing from the hand of the Devil, and accept of nothing but God offers. For, 1 God is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and willing to do us good than the Devil is, unleſs wee think with thoſe wicked ones, that <hi>it is in vain to ſerve the Lord.</hi> 2 An enemy is never ſo dangerous as when hee flattereth and fawneth: hee never kiſſeth but killeth, with <hi>Joab,</hi> or betrayeth with <hi>Judas:</hi> his gifts are dear bought, his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are intollerable: hee will have a better thing for it, even our pretious ſouls. 3 A little from Gods hands is far better than if wee could receive all <hi>the World, and the glory of it,</hi> at the Devils: for this comes with bleſſing, with Promiſe, with Contentment, with good conſcience; ſo doth not the other. Therefore bee the juſt mans portion ſmall or great, it is ever pretious: <hi>it hath no ſorrow added to it,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How may I know I receive any thing from the Devil?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> When any thing is gotten by the breach of any Commandement of God, as by Swearing, Lying, Deceit, Oppreſſion, and the like, this is a gift of the Devil, and the wages of unrighteouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Note here how like the Uſurer is to the Devil: the Devil ſaith, hee will <hi>give,</hi> ſo the Uſurer ſaith hee will lend, which ſhould bee free as gift: but then comes a condition of ten in the hundred, which is more than the lending is worth. Satan is an enemy to all charity, and ſo is hee. The like may bee ſaid of Covetous men, who will do no good, but where they look for return of the like or more, as like the Devil as may bee, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlike to God, who doth good where hee can receive none, ſowes where hee reaps not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. See the miſery of men who accept of Satans profers. 1 Such as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40284:110"/> are in open league with him, as Wizzards, who bind themſelves to renounce God, and their Baptiſm, and Redemption by Chriſt, and to beleeve in the Devil, to expect aid from him, and give him Body and Soul for that help; which is the ſubſtance of the ſolemn Leagues made by ſuch limbs of Satan; hee is of the ſure ſide with them, they can gain nothing by him, unleſs hee gain themſelves firſt. And ſuch by Gods Law ought not to live. 2 Worldly-minded men, with whom hee deals as with <hi>Eſau,</hi> hee gives them a meſſe of pottage, but on condition to ſell their birth-right; a ſilly match is made preſently, an exchange of Earth for Heaven. 3 Men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient in Loſſes or ſickneſſe, who run to the Witch, as not knowing what to do with themſelves. But Satan never eaſeth the body of temporal pains, but to caſt the Soul into eternal. 4 Ambitious and diſcontented perſons, that take preferments of Satan upon baſe conditions: <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſhall have a Kingdome, on condition hee will rebell againſt his own Father. <hi>Zimri</hi> a Captain under <hi>Baaſha,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.10. ſhall have the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if hee will rebell and ſlay his Maſter. Diſcontented Papiſts ſhall divide the Land among themſelves, if they will blow up the Parliament-Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Now if wee would avoid the dangerous compacts with Satan, let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe rules. 1 Beware of prophaneneſſe, which is a ſin, where men careleſly loſe Heaven and the joies thereof for theſe lower and earthly things, as <hi>Eſau</hi> to ſatisfy his luſts <hi>despiſed the bleſſing,</hi> Heb. 12.16. Let there bee none ſuch amongſt us. 2 Beleeve the truth of Gods profers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, to relye on them, and thou ſhalt bee ſenced from Satans lies, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10. 3 Conſider how eaſily men pour out themſelves for <hi>Balaams</hi> wages: Covetouſneſs carries away their whole heart, and yet in the end they are deceived as hee was: inſtead of his reward he was ſlain in his return home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.8. 4 Conſider how little joy there is in that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the Devils hand: neither <hi>Ahab</hi> nor his poſterity injoyed <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard. <hi>Judas</hi> brought back his thirty peeces, and hanged himſelf. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Solomon, The wicked reſteth not that which hee taketh in hunting.</hi> 5 Moderate thy affections, not to deſire the Kingdomes of this World and the glory of them, but a far more glorious Kingdome in the World to come, and all theſe tranſitory matters onely to help thee forward to that.</p>
                     <p>The condition of Satans profer teacheth us further; that,</p>
                     <p>Doct. 2. <hi>All his drift in his temptations, is to draw men from Gods ſervice to his own.</hi> An example whereof wee have in <hi>Saul,</hi> whom hee drew from his hope and truſt in God, to ſeek and ſue to himſelf for help. Hee entered alſo into <hi>Judas</hi> to draw him from his Maſters ſide and ſervice to his own, to make him a Leader and Captain againſt Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.3. Neither fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hee of his purpoſe and ſcope, but effectually prevaileth in the World, and in the <hi>Children of Diſobedience, Eph.</hi> 2.2. For if we look to that part of the World, which is indeed the World, not viſited by the light of Grace, and the Goſpel, they in general are vaſſals to Satan, and profeſs homage and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him in Ceremonies and Rites, as Gods people to God himſelf. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Thoſe things which the Gentiles ſacrifize, they ſacrifize unto Devils, and not unto God:</hi> Which is ſpoken not in reſpect of the intention of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, but of the myſtery in that Idol Worſhipped, which indeed tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Worſhip of the Devil, the deviſer and ſetter forward of the ſame. And at this day in thoſe new-found Countries, experience ſhews, how thoſe Heatheniſh and barbarous people, not having the true knowledge of the true God, do therefore eſteem the Devil as God, and the Devil appearing to them in viſible ſhapes, they fall down and worſhip him, and offer many ſervices and ſacrifices unto him; upon this ground, becauſe God is merciful
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40284:110"/> and amiable, and will not hurt them,
<note place="margin">Non eſt nocent natura Deus. Cic.</note> and therefore they need not bee ſo obſequious to him, but the Devil is terrible, and fearfull, and churliſh, and therefore muſt bee pleaſed and worſhipped, <hi>No no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, Gods own people and children are often drawn from the worſhip of their God, to the worſhip of the Devil, in the moſt baſe and ſubmiſs kind of worſhip. The <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves offered unto Devils, and not unto God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.17. and what did they offer but their deareſt things? as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 106.37. <hi>They offered their ſons and daughters unto Devils:</hi> A marvellous high wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves imitated the barbarous Heathens, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom Satan had brought in this unnatural cruelty, to kill their little children, and offer them to <hi>Molech</hi> in the valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> verſ. 38. Thus they ſhed innocent bloud by a Diabolical fury, and polluted their Land at the Devils inſtigation. Thus it was in the time of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and of <hi>Manaſſeh;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the <hi>Lord ſhewed great indignation and vehemence,</hi> Jer. 7. and 19. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. And the rather, becauſe it was againſt a ſpecial Law enacted for this purpoſe (which we would think Gods own people ſhould not need) <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.7. <hi>They ſhall no more offer to Devils, after whom they have gone a whoring;</hi> and the ſanction follows, <hi>This ſhall be an ordinance for ever.</hi> Yet Gods people forgat Gods inſtitution, and natures inſtinct, and ſo put off all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and natural affection.</p>

                        </label> And this comes to paſs: 1 Becauſe of Satans pride and ambition, who will not content himſelf with any thing but that honour that is due to God. He being <hi>the Prince of the world,</hi> and <hi>the god thereof,</hi> Joh. 14.31. 2 Cor. 4.4. will be worſhipped by the world as a God, and takes upon him as if he were ſo indeed: whereas he is ſo only by his own uſurpation and affectation, and the wickeds deluſion and acceptation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Becauſe of his malice to God, to whom he is moſt contrary. God hath by the Law of Creation, of Nature, the Moral Law, yea by the law of faith, and all other bonds, tied man to his own ſervice: now Satan ſeeks contrarily to deprive God of his due homage, and drawes men from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and practice of Gods Will, that hee may rule them after his own will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Becauſe of his hatred to Mankind, to draw men into the greateſt offence and diſpleaſure of God. <hi>It is an evil thing and bitter, to depart from God and his ſervice:</hi> but to give this to Gods deadly enemy, is a ſin moſt hateful and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It is all the buſineſs that Satan hath in the world, for which he leaves no ſtone unturned, no means unattempted, to ſet up his own kingdom above and againſt Gods Kingdom; a compendious way whereof is to hinder, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or deſtroy the true worſhip of God. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Satan hindred mee:</hi> namely, the true worſhip which <hi>Paul</hi> ſought to eſtabliſh. Hee corrupted the worſhip of God among the Sons of God by the Daughters of men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. And hee ſought to deſtroy all Gods worſhip in the poſterity, by deſtroying <hi>Abel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But is it poſſible that Satan can ſo prevail to draw men to worſhip himſelf in ſtead of God? And what means uſeth he to effect it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea it is plain and uſual, as we ſhall eaſily ſee, if we conſider, 1 The ways that a man worſhippeth the Devil: 2 The means how he bringeth men thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="1">I The ways are laid down in theſe four concluſions:</p>
                     <p>Concluſ. 1. <hi>Whoſoever worſhippeth for God that which is not God, he worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Devil for God.</hi> Deut. 32.17. <hi>They offered unto Devils,</hi> that is, to gods whom they knew not. In all Divine worſhip, whatſoever is not performed to God, is performed to the Devil, there being no mean between them in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40284:111"/> But how hath the Devil drawn Pagans and Heathens to ſet up and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip falſe gods, Devils indeed, <hi>Mars, Jupiter,</hi> &amp;c? yea and Gods own people to worſhip <hi>Dag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n,</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> and <hi>Molech?</hi> At this day all the Eaſtern people of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> worſhip <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a god of their own making. And the Papiſts all give Divine worſhip to Stocks and Stones, the work of mens hands, to Raggs and Reliques, to their Breaden and baked god in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as baſe an Idolatry as can be found among the Heathens: in all which they have fallen down to the Devil, and worſhipped him.</p>
                     <p>Concluſ. 2. <hi>Whoſoever worſhippeth God in any other means than himſelf hath appointed, he worſhippeth the Devil, and not God.</hi> If the manner of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſcribed by himſelf in the Scripture be refuſed, that cannot bee Gods worſhip, becauſe the manner is deviſed by the Devil. Thus doe they who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the true God diſtinct in three Perſons, but worſhip him according to their own deviſes and humane traditions; as the Papiſts that worſhip God in Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Pilgrimages, and a thouſand deviſes, meer ſtrangers to the Spirit of God in Scripture, thruſt in by Satan for his own ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Concluſ. 3. <hi>Numbers will not be perſwaded they worſhip the Devil, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they doe.</hi> For as then we worſhip God actually, when we ſerve and obey him, ſo then men worſhip the Devil, when they doe the works of the Devil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. He that is a ſlave, a vaſſal to the Devil, is an apparent worſhipper of him. Yea, ſo near a ſervice is between them, that the Devil is ſaid to beget many ſons in the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.41. now every ſon honours his father. Thus doe all they that are ſubtile to pervert the ſtraight ways of God, as <hi>Elymas,</hi> therefore called by <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>child of the Devil,</hi> Acts 13.10. becauſe he ſought to hinder the word and work of God. Thus doe all thoſe tares, the children of that <hi>wicked one,</hi> Matth. 13.38. which grow up in Gods field to the moleſting and anoyance of the Lords wheat. Thus doe all they who when they ſhould ſpend the Lords Sabbaths in his worſhip, they worſhip and ſerve the world in buying and ſelling, or the Devil in play and gaming in their own houſes, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to the worſhip of the Devil, when true worſhippers are in Gods houſe, performing their homage and ſervice to him.</p>
                     <p>Concluſ. 4. <hi>Satan prevails againſt numbers, by drawing the affections of their hearts from the true God,</hi> to ſomething beſides him, to love, truſt, and follow it more than God: as the voluptuous perſon, that makes his belly his god, and ſo is a lover of pleaſure more than of God: and the covetous perſon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his wealth his god, whom <hi>Paul</hi> therefore calls an <hi>Idolater.</hi> All theſe and many more are worſhippers of the Devil, and fallen down to him, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly worſhip the true God.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. How and by what means Satan doth thus prevail. And the means are theſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He hath often the Secular arm, and Human authority, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.15. <hi>Rehoboam</hi> ordained Prieſts for the high places, for the Devils, and for the Calves that he had made. Thus Antichriſt, the Beaſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> Revel. 13.16. by power made all both ſmall and great, rich and poor, bond and free, to receive his mark in their hands and fore-heads. So he did in our Country by fire and faggot in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days. 2 Sometimes he draws men to his own worſhip by policy; for he can transform himſelf into an Angel of Light, he can preach Chriſt for a need, to overthrow the preaching of Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.34. he can be a lying ſpirit in the mouthes of four hundred falſe Prophets, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. at once: and can put on the ſhape of <hi>Samuel,</hi> being ſtill a Satan. 3 Sometimes by fair promiſes, as in our text, he will give a whole world to bring Chriſt to one ſin: Thou ſhalt have caſe, pleaſure, wealth, credit; in a word, thy hearts deſire, <hi>if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> 4 By perſwaſion, that it is a vain thing to ſerve God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. no joy for the preſent, no recompence hereafter: thus he carries with him innumerable companies with things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, not conſidering the time to come. 5 By threatning of croſſes, loſſes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40284:111"/> as <hi>Balac</hi> ſaid to <hi>Balaam, Thy God hath kept thee from preferment.</hi> By violent perſecutions, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.13.15. the <hi>red dragon</hi> perſecuted the woman which had brought forth the Man-child; the Serpent caſt out of his mouth waters like a floud, to cauſe the woman to be carried away. 6 By effectual deluſion by means of Signs, Wonders, falſe Miracles and ſlights, which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan putteth forth to give credit to falſe worſhip, as it is ſpoken of the great Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9, 10. that <hi>he ſhall come by the working of Satan, with power, ſigns, and lying wonders, and in all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs among them that periſh:</hi> and thus ſhall the beaſt deceive all thoſe, whoſe names are not written in the Book of life.</p>
                     <p>Thus many are deceived in Popery, by the jugling and crafty conveyances of the Prieſts, and often by Magick, making their Images appear to ſweat, to nodde, to roll their eyes, to paſs voyces through them, and make bloud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Hoſt; which they would have their people beleeve: and thus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan mightily draws them to the worſhip of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Here let us learn to bewail the miſery of men ſeduced by the Devil, and thruſt from their God, whether more openly, or more ſecretly: as, 1 Such as joyn to Popery, renouncing the worſhip of the true God, and fall down to the Devil to worſhip him. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.4. and they worſhipped <hi>the Dragon and the Beaſt:</hi> noting that the worſhip of the Beaſt, is the worſhip of the Dragon. Now they worſhip the Beaſt that give him power over the Scripture, over the Conſciences of men, to make laws to bind them, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſins, to open Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, and receive his Bulls and Canons before the Canonical Scripture. A lamentable thing, that Satan gets ſuch great ones daily to fall down, and worſhip him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Such as get livings by bribery, ſymony, chopping and changing, and ſuch indirect courſes: here the Chaplain hath fallen down to the Devil, and worſhipped him, and he hath beſtowed the benefice.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Such as ſeek to Witches for help, or cunning men and women: a plain and open ſervice of the Devil, by vertue of a league and compact, at leaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. <hi>Should not a people ſeek to their God?</hi> or can all the Devils in Hell remove the hand of God?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Such as by flattery, diſſembling, injuſtice, lying, ſwearng, or breaking the Sabbath, obtain wealth, or profit. All this the Devil hath given thee, becauſe thou haſt fallen down and worſhipped him. Whatſoever a man doth againſt the Word, againſt his Oath, or Conſcience, is a falling down to the Devil, and a worſhipping of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Take heed of coming under the power and ſervice of the Devil: and to that end obſerve theſe rules: 1 Hold thee to Gods Word and Will in all duties of piety and juſtice, both for matter and manner. For wee muſt not only doe our Maſters will, but alſo according to his will. 2 Hear and foſter the motions of Gods Spirit, which are ever according to the Word. It is a note of a man given up to Satan, to have continual diſobedience breathing in him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. The foul ſpirit ſavours nothing but the fleſh. 3 Renounce the world daily, be not a ſervant to any luſt, neither take pleaſure in it. For when Satan findes a man ſerving pleaſures, he halters him with them, and clogs him with cares of riches and voluptuous living, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.14. 4 Walk in the light, love it and ſuch as walk in it. It is a ſign of a man in Satans ſnare, to deſpiſe them that are good, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. to make a ſhew of godlineſs, denying the power thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Satan himſelf pretends light, but walks in darkneſs, and leads ſuch as he rules in the ſame path. 5 Contend for the faith, <hi>Jud.</hi> 3. and Gods pure worſhip, ſtand for God, be at warre with thy ſin, keep an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conflict and combate; for, not to be tempted of Satan, is to be poſſeſſed by him: <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21. <hi>When the ſtrong man keeps the hold, all is at peace.</hi>

The Miniſter muſt uſe his gifts, not for any private end, but for Gods glory, as a good ſervant that gains all for his Maſter. And every private man muſt ſo carry his courſe of life, his trade, his ſpeeches, as God may bee honoured in all things: his light in all things muſt ſhine, that our heavenly Father may be glorified: therefore in every thing whether it will carry the commendation not only of truth and honeſty, but of Chriſtianity and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>To ſtir us up to this duty, ſee ſome motives:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 All Creatures in their kind doe glorifie God, and keep their ſtanding, the Sun, the Starres, <hi>the heavens declare the glory of God.</hi> Pſal. 19.1. <hi>The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe the maſter of his crib,</hi> Iſa. 1.3. <hi>The Crane Swallow, and Turtle know their times,</hi> Jer. 8.1. What a ſhame for <hi>Iſrael</hi> then not to acknowledge their Benefactor, but come ſo farre behind the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures? VVhat a ſhame for Chriſtians to come behind the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who partake in farre greater mercies and means than they did?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hereby wee manifeſt our ſelves to bee the ſervants of God, in reſiſting the diſhonour of God, and ſtanding out for our Lord, againſt Satan, wicked men, hypocrites, whoſe whole deſire is to obſcure and darken the glory of God, and as farre as they can with violence to tread it under foot: Eſpecially having vowed in our Baptiſm ſo to doe. He is a Coward that ſeeing the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and alacrity of the enemy, is not by it provoked to ſtout reſiſtance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſtanding in a good cauſe, and ſure of victory. Can a child endure his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be diſhonoured and wronged by word or deed, and put it up? Can Gods child, ſeeing <hi>a ſon honours his father?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 Our time is but ſhort, we are in our laſt conflict, the time of our full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and introduction into heavenly glory is at hand, the Crown is in our eye, almoſt upon our heads already: and therefore let us encourage our ſelves a while to be inſtant for the glory of God, which is our laſt ſcope and chief expectation: even as a Traveller that ſees the Evening come upon him, is ſo much the quicker till he attain the place he deſires; ſo we having the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40284:113"/> of our life approach, and our laſt hour, ſhould ſet our ſelves forward with more ſpeed and alacrity towards our home, holding on our right way, which is the glorifying of God in all things.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 We have a cloud of examples before us: 1 <hi>Of holy men,</hi> who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured Martyrdom, and rejoyced in the flames, that they were worthy by their ſo exquiſite torments to glorifie God, as Chriſt told <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>by ſuch a death he ſhould glorifie God.</hi> 2 <hi>Of holy Angels,</hi> who ſpend all eternity in magnifying Gods holineſs and glory: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.3. one cries to another, <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord:</hi> the whole world is full of his glory: and, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. <hi>Glory be to God in the higheſt heavens.</hi> And ſhall not we approach to the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical life, which is the happieſt of all creatures? 3 <hi>Of the bleſſed Son of God</hi> our Head, whoſe whole life was nothing elſe but a ſeeking of the glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And ſhould not the members imitate the Head? Have wee ſo many faithful guides in ſo dangerous a way, and ſhould we be ſo cold and ſlow in the imitation of them?</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Our glorification is individually knit to our glorifying of God: as, 1 Sam. 2.30. <hi>Him that honoureth me, will I honour.</hi> Yea Chriſt claims his glory on no other condition but this, but that he had <hi>glorified his Father on earth,</hi> Joh. 17.4. As among men, great benefactors are well pleaſed with ſmall teſtimonies of thankfulneſs, where ability wants to perform much: ſo the Lord accepts our ſmall obedience and ſtudy of glorifying him, that hee plentifully remunerates it.</p>

                     <p>And Chriſt doth now ſo tearm him, 1 To ſhew him that he takes better no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him than before: for he called him by no name before, though he was called by the two former tearms by the Evangeliſt. 2 That we ſhould ſee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into his nature, the more to beware of, and deteſt him. 3 To ſhew us how we may detect an adverſary, and ſmell a Devil; namely, when he ſets againſt and oppoſeth the grounds of religion. 4 To teach us that hee is no friend, that offering us wealth and honour, would draw us from God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The greateſt kindneſs here is the greateſt cruelty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Avoyd]</hi> 1 This is a word of indignation, as we ſay to a Dogg, avant: for Chriſt was much offended and angry againſt this temptation, when he ſaw and heard Satan ſo impudent and blaſphemous. So Chriſt gives this as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40284:114"/> of the ſame ſpeech to <hi>Peter, Avoid Satan;</hi> for thou art an offence unto mee. Chriſt ſhews indignation, becauſe Satan ſhews his blackneſs. 2 It is a word of rebuke and caſtigation of Satans importunity and impudency, who would not bee ſatisfied at the firſt and ſecond aſſault, but ſtill renews more helliſh and horrible temptations. Thus <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Hence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde mee,</hi> as one not worthy any longer to behold his face. 3 It is a word of diſmiſſion, or ſending him packing, and carries in it the force of a Commandement. <hi>An Heretick</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>after once or twice admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion avoid, Tit.</hi> 3.10. Thus deals our Saviour with Satan here, who is <hi>Haeretico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum haereticiſſimus:</hi> An Arch-Heretick: as a great man talking with a wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling fellow, whom no reaſon will perſwade, commands him away, hee will hear him no longer.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Why was our Saviour ſo angry at this temptation above the former, wherein he exerciſed Meekneſs and Patience?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 His Wiſdome knew how far hee was to bear Satan at this time, and how much to ſuffer from him, and then how his mouth muſt bee ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, which Meekneſs and Lenity would never do: there is no hope to win or overcome a Devil with kindneſſe, nor to ſhake him off that way; nay, rather this will more invite on his malice, he will go ſo far as hee is ſuffered. 2 Chriſt thirſted after mans ſalvation; and his love to us and our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made him ſo angry with the Devil, who ſought by all means to hinder it: for had hee been defiled with ſin, the work of redemption had availed us nothing. 3 To note the hatefulneſs and deteſtation of that ſin of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whether it bee covert or open, that if our deareſt friends ſhould ſolicite unto it, even the Wife of the boſome, wee ſhould purſue them to death, and ſo ſhew our deadly hatred againſt it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1.6. 4 The two former more concerned himſelf, but this concerned his Fathers Glory directly: hee hears him claiming all to bee his, quartering the Armes and Royalties of God, making himſelf a God, and challenging worſhip due to God: this hee could not bear: his tenderneſs and zeal to his Fathers glory, would not endure ſo vile a creature to carry away, no not to challenge any part of his worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>Gods cauſes muſt ever more affect us than our own.</hi> How full of lowlineſs and meekneſs was our Lord and Saviour in all his own cauſes? Hee did not ſtrive nor cry, neither was his voice heard in the ſtreets: <hi>Hee would not break a bruiſed reed, nor quench a ſmoaking flax,</hi> Iſa. 42.3. Matth. 12.20. <hi>When hee was reviled, hee reviled not again:</hi> When hee was called <hi>Glutton Drunkard, a friend of Publicans and ſinners, Matth.</hi> 11.19, 28. in ſtead of returning rough Language, hee calleth, ſaying, <hi>Come unto mee all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will caſe you.</hi> Hee was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, and opened not his mouth: when they accuſed him of capital things, knowing that his anſwers would not bee taken, hee anſwered not a word. Now hee was in his own cauſe. But when hee takes his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cauſe in hand, how doth hee cloath himſelf with zeal, which even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes him? <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. in purging his Fathers houſe, hee laies about him, and whips out the abuſers of that holy place. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his own private cauſe was the meekeſt man upon <hi>the earth;</hi> being contumeliouſly worded by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> hee preſently pardons it, and prayeth for <hi>Miriam,</hi> and gets her cured of her leproſy. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. that froward people was ready to ſtone him: yet when God begins to bee angry with them, hee forgets all, and <hi>praies God rather to put his name out of his book, than not to pardon their ſins.</hi> But, ſeeing the calf, his calm ſpirit is vaniſhed, and hee breaks the Tables of ſtone that were in his hand. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> every where provokes Chriſtians to meekneſs, patience, and laying aſide of revenge, and ſtirringneſs of ſpirit in private cauſes: yet (<hi>Act.</hi> 17.16.) when hee ſaw the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40284:114"/> idolatry of the <hi>Athenians, his spirit was ſtirred up in him.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3 Our Lord Jeſus hath more affected our cauſe than his own: what an infinite love ſhewed hee in deſcending from his glory, to work the great and painful work of our redemption? what infinite miſery did hee ſuſtain to help us out of it? what an happineſſe forſook he to recover us to that which wee had forſaken? what a dear price did hee pay for our ranſome, when we were loſt? Is it not fit now, that wee ſhould bee earneſt in the cauſe of ſuch a friend? May not hee well diſdain, that any thing in the World (never ſo much concerning us) ſhould bee preferred before him, yea, or equalled with, or loved without him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Do wee know that God himſelf is the chief good, and ſhould not wee caſt our eyes beyond our ſelves, ſinful lumps and heaps of duſt, that all the ſprings of our affections might run into this main? Shall wee beſtow the pitch of our affections upon lower things (as earthly-minded men do) when wee may ſatiate them with God himſelf, and the things of his glory?</p>
                     <p n="5">5 There is no loſs in neglecting our ſelves for God, but great advantage: for his eye is upon us to bee a ſpeedy, faithful, and royal rewarder of us. The preferring of our Lords cauſe above our ſelves, is the preferment of our ſelves in the end. <hi>Hee that loſeth his life for my ſake</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall find it.</hi> And therefore as <hi>Caeſars</hi> eye made his Souldiers prodigal of their blood; ſo Gods eye upon us ſhould make our ſelves ſmall in our own eyes, that his glory may bee maintained and reſerved wholly to himſelf. <hi>Moſes</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gods honour before his own: for hee looked for the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The Uſe hereof belongs to ſuch as are ſpecially ſet forth to ſet up Gods cauſes. The Magiſtrate is not now a private man, to ſeek himſelf, or to ſet forward his own deſigns, or to ſhew his heat in his own private cauſes, but to prefer Gods cauſes before all mens, his own or others. <hi>David</hi> a King, how calm was hee in his own caſe, when <hi>Shimei</hi> trayterouſly railed upon him, and <hi>Abiſhai</hi> would have fetched his head, <hi>Oh no</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>God hath bid him rail, &amp;c?</hi> But when Gods cauſe was in hand, <hi>Oh then, away from not yee wicked:</hi> and, <hi>I will have no wicked perſon in my houſe, I will timely deſtroy the wicked from the houſe of God.</hi> Good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> neglecteth his own allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and departed from his own right for the peoples ſake, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. but <hi>cha.</hi> 13. how zealous is hee for God? hee will not let God loſe his right: not one whit of the Sabbath muſt bee allowed to any uſe but Sabbath-duties. Such a courage for God and the Truth, ought the Magiſtrate to have, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for fear of men, nor any mans favour or affection, hee neglect any thing which God would have him do, eſpecially for the houſe of God, and the Offices of it. Alas, how many Magiſtrates are of <hi>Gallios</hi> minde, to think religion but a matter of words, as if God made them governours of men only, but not of Chriſtians? keepers of the ſecond Table to preſerve
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40284:115"/> Peace and Juſtice, and not of the firſt to preſerve Piety and Religion? and if they bee ſo, why are not Blaſphemies, and horrible Oaths, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prophanations of the Sabbath ſeverely puniſhed? why are not Popiſh and prophane perſons compelled to come into the houſe of God? Shall a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer of a trifle of a mans goods know, that the Magiſtrate bears not the Sword in vain, and ſhall not hee that robs God of his Glory, by Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Swearing, contemptuous breaking of the Sabbath know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?</p>
                     <p>The calling of a Miniſter is more ſpecially to promote the cauſes of God, which therefore muſt affect him above all his own reſpects. How earneſt was Chriſt in his Fathers work, when his Parents came to ſeek him at twelve years old? hee rebuked them for interrupting him; whereas in all private converſe hee gave them reverence, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. When his Diſciples brought him meat, hee neglected that alſo, ſaying, <hi>It is my meat and drink, to do the wilt of my Father.</hi> And if preferring Gods cauſes will not ſuffer us to reſpect our ſelves, much leſs will wee bee hindered by others: wee cannot tune our ſongs to mens ears, but muſt deal faithfully and plainly, though wee diſpleaſe men. How zealous was Chriſt againſt the Hypocriſy of the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. though it created him much envy and malice? When hee ſaw the invincible hardneſſe of Heart in his hearers, how did hee mourn in his ſpirit, and looked angerly about him? <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.5. Surely if wee go about to pleaſe men, or ſet up our ſelves in the World, Gods cauſes will affect us ſlenderly: Therefore it ſhall bee our happy portion to ſet the top of our ambition the glory of God, and in our judgements and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, prefer the winning of ſouls before the winning of the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Let every man learn to conſider what buſineſſe God hath put in his hand to do, and not bee hindered in that; for that is Gods work. Gods cauſe, upon which depends ſome part of Gods glory. And whatſoever he may glorify God in, for which hee can warrant his calling, let him ſet that forward, and let no reſpect hinder him: let him not ſuffer God to bee diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in his family, nor where hee can hinder it: let the ſpirit of patience ſwallow a number of private and perſonal wrongs; but, when God comes to be wronged, let him ſtir up the ſpirit of zeal and courage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Here many are reproved, who fail againſt this Doctrin: as, 1 Men that follow nature, abandoning religion, hot and fiery in their own quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, not a word can bee ſooner uttered againſt them, but they are ready to draw, and to ſtab: Their own names may not be mentioned without all due reſpect: But for Gods cauſes and quarrels, let others look to that. How h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh beware by theſe examples of more zeal in thine own cauſe, than in Gods; in thy own name; than in God. 2 Such Oſtriches as can digeſt any high contempt of God, without indignation or reproof, and can ſuffer men to ſwear and curſe by God and Chriſt, his blood, wounds, and tear him to ſmall peeces. It would bee thought diſloyalty to hear the Kings Majeſties name or title contumeliouſly ſpoken of, and not bring the party to condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. It was an old Law among the Romans, that if any man did ſwear by their God <hi>Janus,</hi> it ſhould bee death, unleſs the Senate approved it, or it were made before a Prieſt: why? that it might bee either puniſhed or reproved. It were well if wee had ſuch a Law amongſt us. 3 When care of our own houſes eat up the care of Gods houſe: Things ſhall be neat and convenient at home, no care how Gods houſe lies. When baſe trifles are preferred before Gods Word, and the good ſetling of it; as ſtage-plaies and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40284:115"/> enterludes. When Gods Sabbaths and time muſt give place to our callings, or recreations, or are paſſed away in Gods Worſhip, more heavily than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daies, or work-daies. Here is a man affected more with his own ſin, than the higheſt cauſes of Gods glory.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The reaſon of our Saviours denial: <hi>For it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Saviour had ſharply reproved Satans impudence in his bold onſet this third time; but yet becauſe it is not ſufficient to thruſt off an adverſary with heat of words and ſharp reproaches, unleſs there bee added alſo a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect anſwer and ſatisfaction to the matter in hand: he therefore moſt fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth by the Scriptures, even the Devil himſelf, not contenting himſelf by his power to repel him, which Satan now beginneth to feel, unleſs alſo by the power of the Word hee convince him, and thereby award the dart, and break the temptation into pieces.</p>
                     <p>Which muſt bee our rule in dealing with vain and jangling adverſaries; not to anſwer them according to their fooliſh diſpoſition or provocation, not to bee like them in frowardneſs or ſtifneſſe, in heat and perverſneſſe, but to anſwer them with words of Wiſdome, with ſound matter, and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both to convince them, and beat down ſelf-conceit in them; which is the meaning of thoſe two Precepts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4, 5. which ſeem contrary: but are eaſily reconciled by the due reſpect of perſons, places, times, and other circumſtances. Ever remember one rule, that no adverſary (ſuppoſe the Devil himſelf) is to bee anſwered by affection or paſſion, but by judgement and ſound reaſon: Yea, if wee have no hope to win our adverſary, or do him much good, as Chriſt had none of the Devil, yet wee muſt teſtify to God and his truth for the confirmation of our ſelves and others.</p>
                     <p>The teſtimony alledged is out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God: thou ſhall ſerve him:</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. An univerſal and affirmative precept, by which every creature is bound to his Creator, and him alone, to perform Divine worſhip unto him. And it is aptly applyed by Chriſt to this dart of Satan: For it implyeth, 1 That hee himſelf, as now ſtanding in this conflict with Satan, is a creature of God as hee is man, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe as God hee hee equal to his Father. As man hee is ſubject to the Law, and to this precept among the reſt. 2 That Satan is not God, as hee pretendeth by his unjuſt claimes, nor any way equal to God. 3 That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither muſt hee being a creature, give the leaſt divine worſhip from God, nor hee that thus claimes it, can by any means bee capable of it. 4 That the Scriptures of God reſerve unto God his due worſhip, and forbid that any creature ſhall ſhare with him. Chriſt ſtands not to diſpute whether the ſight preſented were a ſhadow or ſubſtance, nor whether hee would give it him or no, but holds him to the Scripture, which upholds his Fathers right.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But why doth our Saviour change, and adde to the text of</hi> Scripture, <hi>as not regarding that terrible woe denounced againſt ſuch as adde or take away from the word and contrary to that, in</hi> Deut. 12.32. <hi>Here our Saviour,</hi> 1 <hi>Changeth:</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaith,</hi> Thou ſhalt fear: <hi>Chriſt ſaith,</hi> Thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: 2 <hi>Addeth: for</hi> Moſes <hi>hath not the word</hi> only, <hi>which is of Chriſts putting to that text.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Here is ſome difference indeed in words, but not in ſenſe, and therefore it is no corruption of the Text, nor letting out the life of it, which ſtands not in the words, but in the true ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Our Lord both in great wiſdome changeth the word <hi>fear</hi> into <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and juſt cauſe: for, 1 <hi>Moſes</hi> uſeth <hi>fear,</hi> which is a general word, in which is contained all ſuch Divine duties as godly men ought to perform unto God: and our Saviour mentions one ſpecial, which is included in that general;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40284:116"/> which thing <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks as well as he, in the general; as he that commands a whole, commands every part, inward and outward. 2 Hereby our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our aptly meets with Satans temptation, <hi>If thou wilt worſhip me;</hi> he uſeth the ſame word, not tying himſelf to <hi>Moſes</hi> his words, but keeping the ſenſe, but to Satans word: and, 3 He noteth the nearneſs and undividedneſs of Gods fear and his worſhip; as where the cauſe is, there will bee the effect, ſo true fear and worſhip goe together; where one is, there will be the other: and for this cauſe one is put for the other, not here only, but elſewhere, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. <hi>Their fear toward me was taught by the precept of men:</hi> Chriſt alleadging it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. ſaith, You <hi>worſhip</hi> me in vain.</p>
                     <p>As for the word <hi>only</hi> added, which is not in the Law, it no way addeth any contrary or diverſe ſenſe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but only expoundeth or giveth a fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary to the text, and ſpeaketh that plainly in one word, which <hi>Moſes</hi> doth in more: as <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, and ſerve him, and walk after no other gods:</hi> which is all one with our Saviours, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſerve him only.</hi> As he that ſaith, The King is the ſupream Governour, and none but hee; ſaith in effect, The King is the only ſupream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Chriſt and his Apoſtles had a priviledge in alleadging Scriptures without error, and were in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ble expounders as well as alleadgers.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 This alteration of words is made by Chriſt, to warrant us, that Scriptures alleadged by teachers according to their right ſenſe (although with alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and additions) are to be taken as true expoſitions and allegations, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not tied ſo ſtrictly to words as to ſenſe: For otherwiſe, all our Sermons and Expoſitions, which ſerve to beat out the true ſenſe of Scriptures and apply it to ſeveral uſes, might be condemned as idle additions to Scripture; which is blaſphemous.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 To warrant us, that Principles of Religion expounded by warrant of Scripture are truly interpreted, though the Scriptures in ſo many formal words expreſs them not. As for example: In the Doctrin of Juſtification by faith, we ſay we are juſtified by faith <hi>only</hi> before God; here the Papiſts exclaim on us as accurſed Hereticks, becauſe we read not the word <hi>only,</hi> in all the Scripture. But we read it in effect, and in true ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. and, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By faith without works;</hi> which excluſive is all one as to ſay, <hi>only by faith,</hi> as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our interprets the excluſion of other gods by the word <hi>only.</hi> As if I ſhould ſay, I did ſuch a thing without help; is it not all one as to ſay, I only did it? If Chriſts interpretation be true and warrantable, ſo muſt ours in the point of juſtification. And if the Devil himſelf had not yeelded to Chriſts allegation, he might have ſaid, Thou thruſteſt in the word <hi>only,</hi> and addeſt to Gods Word, and therefore art not the Son of God. But the Papiſts deal more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently with us, than the Devil did with Chriſt, who ſaid no ſuch thing, but yeelded to evidence of truth, which they will not.</p>
                     <p>In the precept it ſelf are three things: 1 The perſon: 2 The matter: 3 The object. 1 The peſon, <hi>thou]</hi> the whole man and perſon, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of a body and ſoul: <hi>thou,</hi> any reaſonable Creature that challengeſt God to be thy God. 2 The matter <hi>ſhalt worſhip and ſerve.</hi> Worſhip is two-fold, Civil, or Divine.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Civil, is a proſtrating or bowing of the body, or any outward teſtification of an high and reverent reſpect of man. And this is due to men two ways. 1 <hi>Of duty,</hi> when men are to bee reverently acknowledged for ſomething wherein God hath preferred them before us, as for years, gifts, graces, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: or ſuch as are ſet over us, as Parents and Fathers of bodies and ſouls, of Church, and Country. And this is required by the fifth Commandement, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 7. neither doth the Goſpel and Chriſtianity take away, but teach civility. And performed by the godly, both in ſpeech, as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaid, <hi>O King;</hi>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:40284:116"/> and <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Feſtus, O noble Feſtus:</hi> and alſo in outward behaviour and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as <hi>Jacob</hi> bowed ſeven times to <hi>Eſau;</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> taking his Sons from the knees of his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> having bleſſed them, did reverence to his Father down to the ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.12. <hi>David</hi> inclined his face to the earth, and bowed himſelf to <hi>Saul,</hi> who purſued his life, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.9. The like of <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Boaz,</hi> chap. 2. and of <hi>Abigail</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.23. ſhe fell on her face, and bowed her ſelf to the ground, and fell at his feet. 2 <hi>Of courteſie,</hi> which is a fruit of humility, when a man to his equals and inferiours ſheweth reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect; as <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 13.8, 9. and to the <hi>Hittites</hi> his inferiours, <hi>cap.</hi> 23.12. he bowed himſelf before the people of the Land: Farr unlike the ſurlineſs and ſtiffneſs of proud and conceited perſons, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voyd of all good nature, nurture, and religion, know not to bow to any, neither their betters in the way of duty, nor equalls in way of courteſie.</p>
                     <p>Divine worſhip is two-fold, 1 Inward, the ſum of the firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtanding in fear, love, and the like: 2 Outward bowing or reverence, the ſum of the ſecond Commandement. The former bindes the ſoul, and the will, and affections, and the whole inner man: the later the outward man, to give God his worſhip and ſervice, and to give no part of that to any other: For the word <hi>only,</hi> only mentioned in the latter branch, muſt bee extended and referred to the former too. The latter of theſe is here meant:

                        </note> for the word properly ſignifieth to kiſs or adore, by ſome outward geſture to manifeſt a veneration. 1 Becauſe this was it which Satan required of Chriſt, namely, to fall down or bow unto him: but Chriſt aptly refuſeth it. 2 This worſhip proceeds from an inward fear and apprehenſion of a Divine excellency and power, not communicable to any Creature, which Satan well know: for even by this bowing he would have Chriſt to acknowledge in him a power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all earthly things, which is proper to God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And him only ſhalt thou ſerve.]</hi> By <hi>ſervice</hi> is not meant the inward ſervice of the heart: for the words in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord, and ſerve him,</hi> will not bear it: the firſt thereof betokening the inward ſervice, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the outward, following the former as the effect the cauſe. Neither would our Saviour invert the order, in ſetting the ſtream before the fountain. Therefore this word <hi>ſerve,</hi> ſerveth to expound the former, as an addition, ſignifying nothing elſe but the outward ſervice of God; ſo that Chriſt here ſhews, that it is not enough to give God outward reverence, but that wee muſt (as ſervants) perform duties according to his will: ſo the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, being taken from ſervants,

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> They differ greatly: 1 In the kind, one is ſervil, the other ſocial; the former due to an abſolute Lord and Commander, the latter due from one fellow-ſervant to another. This diſtinction is grounded in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.10. where the Angel refuſed the worſhip done him by <hi>John,</hi> upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40284:117"/> he was <hi>a fellow-ſervant, and one of the brethren:</hi> for <hi>John</hi> being overcome with the greatneſs of the Angels glory and ſplendor, out of humane infirmity aſcribed to him more than civil honour, and mixed ſome religious worſhip with it, which only was due to God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Another difference is in the intention of the mind in worſhipping. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious bowing is, when a man inwardly apprehends a Divine power proper to God, and incommunicable to the creature; or, when god-head or divine properties are conceived in the thing bowed unto. As for example: in falling down to an Image, uncovering the head, praying, &amp;c. the mind now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Divine power in the image of knowing ones thoughts, hearing, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like; at leaſt that God hath tied his preſence and grace to ſuch a place where ſuch an Image is ſet up. But the civil bowing to the King, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, or to the Chair of eſtate, is a meer token of civil ſubjection, without any conceit of deity in the mind, only becauſe we ſee in them excellent gifts of God, or in place above in the Church, Common-wealth, or family. For the ſame geſture may be civil and ſpiritual, according to the intention of the mind of the worſhipper.</p>

As for example: Kiſſing of the Popes feet, is a worſhip done to a man, and ſo ſeems civil; but, being tendred to him as to the Vicar of Chriſt, as one that can pardon ſins, and cannot erre, this religious end makes it a religious worſhip, and therefore none of his, being not offered to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince or Emperour upon the earth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Some difference may be taken from the common eſtimation of the thing worſhipped, as if it be generally eſteemed or reputed Divine, and deity aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to that which in it ſelf hath it not: The Hoſt (as they call it) is generally held to be Chriſts very ſelf: now for a man (ſuppoſe a Proteſtant, that knows it to remain very bread, and that no ſuch deity or change is in it) to bow down before it, to uncover his head, or uſe geſtures of adoration to it, is an external religious geſture, and is unlawful, although his intention bee not to worſhip it, but becauſe in common eſtimation he aſcribes a kind of God-head to the creature as others doe. And whereas adoration is a ſign of ſubjection to the thing adored, and a note of inferiority in deed, or in will; by this geſture this perſon makes himſelf inferiour to a Creature, and giveth worſhip and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence to that which in his knowledge hath neither life nor ſenſe, which is ſenſleſs, and againſt common reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 A plain difference between Civil worſhip and Divine, is, that all Divine worſhip is abſolute and immediate; which is plain in this inſtance: God in all his Commandements muſt be abſolutely and ſimply obeyed, with full obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, never calling any of them into queſtion, never expoſtulating or reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the matter with God, ſeem they to us never ſo unreaſonable. As <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> againſt the Law Moral, and even againſt the Law of Nature, without all reaſoning, riſeth up early to kill his own ſon, when God bids him, who will be ſimply obeyed for himſelf. But all obedience to men is reſpective, to God, in God, and for God, and as farre as God hath appointed them to be obeyed, and no further. God muſt be obeyed againſt the Magiſtrate, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate not againſt God, but ſo farre as his Commandements are agreeable to Gods. Man as man is not to be obeyed, but becauſe God hath ſet him over us in the Church, Common-wealth, or Family.</p>
                     <p>Whence we ſee, that Civil worſhip hath his riſe and ground in the worſhip of God; and what is the cauſe, that ſo little reverence is given to ſuperiours, whether Magiſtrates or Miniſters, Maſters or Parents, in theſe diſſolute and unmannerly days, but becauſe Gods worship decays, and is not laid in the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40284:117"/> hearts of inferiours, the force of whoſe Commandement would force reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſuperiours? What other cauſe is there, that inferiour impudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of both ſexes take ſuch liberty (without all reſpect of conſcience, truth, or manners) to chatter againſt Gods Miniſters and the Kings, towards both whom God hath commanded more than ordinary reſpect; yea with all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs to ſcoft, rail, curſe, threaten, with horrible, damnable, and inceſſant Oathes, more like Furies than men, even to their faces? but that Gods fear is utterly ſhaken out of their hearts: and where Gods fear is abſent, how can we expect any fear of men? The Heathen Prieſts were honoured, becauſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then gods were feared: which ſhall condemn Chriſtians, among whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods Prieſts and Miniſters, nor the Miniſters of the King, Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, and conſequently, not God himſelf is feared and honoured.</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>All religious worſhip, whether outward or inward, is due to God only.</hi> For inward worſhip, it is moſt expreſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. <hi>God being a Spirit, hee muſt bee worſhipped in ſpirit and truth:</hi> And it might be proved in all the parts of inward worſhip; as 1 Love: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy ſoul.</hi> 2 Fear: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Let him be thy fear and dread: Fear him that is able to caſt both body and ſoul into hell.</hi> 3 Truſt and confidence: <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Truſt in God with all thy heart.</hi> 4 Faithful prayer: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the time of trouble:</hi> and, <hi>How can they call on him in whom they have not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> But of this there is little queſtion. As for outward worſhip, if religious, all of it is his due only. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6. <hi>Come, let us kneel before him, and bow down to God our Maker:</hi> Whence it is manifeſt, that all the geſtures and ſigns of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip, as bowing of the body, of knees, lifting up of eyes, or hands, and uncovering the head with religious intention, is not to bee yeelded to any but the true God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 A reaſon hereof is in the text, becauſe <hi>he only is the Lord our God:</hi>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Our doctrin condemns the preſenting of ones body at the external Divine worſhip of any thing which is not God: and conſequently, a man may not be preſent at falſe worſhip to give it the leaſt allowance, no not in geſture. Whence they are convicted of dealing falſe with God, who preſent their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at the Maſs, with a conceit that they can keep their hearts to God well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. For, 1 Might not our Lord for a whole world have found by all his wiſdom ſuch a preſent help for him, and by ſuch a policy have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached the Devil himſelf, who required only external bowing, keeping his heart ſtill unto God? No: our Lord knew well, 1 That body and ſoul
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40284:120"/> make but one man, who muſt have but one God, one Lord, one Faith, one Worſhip. 2 That our bodies are the Lords as well as our ſouls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. created for his ſervice as well as they, redeemed by Chriſts bloud as well as they. 3 That he that requireth the whole heart, requireth alſo the whole ſtrength which is of the body. 4 That the ſoul cannot be in Heaven, if the body be in Hell; neither can he bow the knee of his heart to God, that bows the knee of his body to Satan. 5 That there can be no agreement between Light and Darkneſs, God and <hi>Belial:</hi> the Ark and Dagon cannot ſtand in the ſame Temple, and the heart cannot at the ſame time be the Temple of God and of Idols.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This is the difference between the Church of God, and the Synagogue of Satan, that the one is a chaſte wiſe and ſpouſe of Chriſt, and keeps her to her husband alone, and doth not admit others to the uſe of her ſaith: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plays the harlot with many Lovers, and keeps not her ſaith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to God alone, but permits others to be fellows with him at the ſame time. Now no man can take her for a chaſte and undefiled Spouſe, that will give the uſe of her body to a ſtranger, though ſhee plead never ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that ſhee keeps her heart to her husband. The caſe here is the very ſame.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Here is a number of ſins infolded in this one action. 1 Here is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt appearance of evil, which we ſhould flie, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.22. 2 An occaſion of offence to others, to draw them in by our example, and, ſo farre as wee may, a deſtroying of him for whom Chriſt hath dyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. 3 A fight againſt faith, and an allowance of that which a man condemneth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Bleſſed is he that condemneth not himſelf in that he alloweth.</hi> His body allows that which his heart condemnes. 4 Here is a denial of Chriſt, whoſe faith he ought to confeſs and profeſs with his mouth; which he would doe, if it were in ſoundneſs hid in the heart. 5 Here is a daſtardly joyning with his Lords enemy: for <hi>he that is not with him is againſt him.</hi> 6 Here is not only an approbation, but a communication in Idolatry; a touching of pitch, and a defiling of a mans ſelf; a moſt preſent danger of infection, and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from God. 7 Here is an hypocritical ſhow of that which the heart ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres; a divided man, and divided manner of worſhip, which God hateth who requireth the whole man. 8 Experience ſhews, that ſuch as give up their bodies to Idols, God in juſtice for the moſt part gives up the heart to horrible deluſions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 If we muſt <hi>avoyd an Heretick</hi> then much more an Idolater. Wee muſt not only <hi>hate the doctrine of the Nicolaitans,</hi> but <hi>avoyd it.</hi> Many ſay they hate the Maſs; but I ſay, then they would avoyd it: for we ſeparate our bodies, not only our hearts, from the things we hate.

                     <p n="5">5 Such perſons keep not their hearts to God, that preſent their bodies at I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry: neither preſent they their bodies only; for the Soul governs the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Will leads the Action, the Underſtanding the Will, and the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions attend the Underſtanding. Now where there is underſtanding, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will, and affections, given to the Idol-worſhip, is not more than the body given, even the chief and higheſt faculties of the ſoul? Of which wee can reckon no better than plowing with an Oxe and an Aſſe, or ſowing the ſame field with divers ſeeds, which the Lord in the Law forbiddeth, and therein refuſeth the mixture of warrantable and unwarrantable rites in his worſhip. God is a Spirit and truth, and will not be worſhipped in ſpirit and falſehood. A diſſembled worſhip is a mark of a true neutral, of a plain

And indeed both thoſe famous Divines departed from this anſwer, and gave a ſounder in their latter works, as appears both in Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his <hi>Caſes of Conſcience,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Zanchius</hi> his Book <hi>De redemptione.</hi>

And this word in the Hebrew, is taken from Servants, who beſides inward reverence, and outward worſhip, owe to their Maſters their ſtrength, labour, and ſervice, yea, frank and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obedience. And ſuppoſe any man have a Servant, who will bee very Complemental, and give his Maſter cap and knee, and very good words, yet when his Maſter commands him any thing, hee will not do it, here is honour, but no ſervice; and denying ſervice, hee plainly ſhews that his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is but diſſembled and hypocritical. So as this ſervice to God (as to earthly Maſters) ſtands, 1 in fear, and reverent inward affection: 2 in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ready obedience, in all holy and civil actions. For,</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſervice of God is either Legal, or Evangelical. The former ſtands in a perfect conformity with the whole Law of God, when the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can preſent unto God a perſonal and total righteouſneſs. Of this kind is the ſervice of the bleſſed Angels. Of the ſame kinde was <hi>Adams</hi> in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Of the ſame was Chriſts ſervice, when hee was made obedient to the death, <hi>that by the obedience of one, many might bee made righteous.</hi> This is that by which wee ſhall ſerve God in heaven, when wee ſhall once again recover perfect ſanctification, and the whole Image of God, which we have now loſt. This now wee cannot attain unto; yet wee muſt ever carry it in our eye as our ſcope and aim.</p>
                     <p>Evangelical ſervice is, when the heart being regenerate by Gods Spirit, and purified by Faith, hath Chriſts obedience imputed unto it, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as its own perfect obedience, and now indeavours to obey God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in all things. In a word, that is Evangelical ſervice, which is perfect in Chriſt, begun and inchoat in us; in him compleat, in us ſincere, and upright, which is Chriſtian perfection.</p>
                     <p>And to know this ſervice the better, wee will ſet down the conditions of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">I.

The ſervice of the godly reſembles the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven, who are ſaid to have wings, by which their will and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs is figured in doing the beſts of God. <hi>David</hi> had not ſuch wings to flye ſwiftly, yet hee would <hi>run in the way of Gods Commondements</hi> ſo faſt as the burden of fleſh would ſuffer him.

                     <p>Now God ruleth his whole ſervice in reſpect of the 1 matter, 2 manner, 3 end.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. For the matter. Whatſoever I command, that do onely, ſaith the Lord. Thou ſhalt not do that which is good in thine own eyes, but what I command thee. And ſo wee are taught to pray, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi>

                     <p n="1">I. Abſolute, without all condition on our part; whereas all ſervice to men muſt bee conditional. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe God being holineſs it ſelf, can command nothing but what is moſt juſt and holy, but men may.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Total, both <hi>objective</hi> and <hi>ſubjective.</hi> 1 It muſt bee total in reſpect of the object; <hi>all</hi> Gods Commandements, <hi>all</hi> which call for our obedience. Partial and delicate ſervice, when wee liſt, or at leiſure, as the retainers of great men on feaſt-daies, is not that which liketh him, but a conſtant dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in all his Commandements, and a conſcionable indeavour in <hi>all.</hi> General ſervice was holy <hi>Davids</hi> aim, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>Then ſhall I not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, when I have reſpect to all thy Commandements.</hi> Not that wee can perfectly ſerve him, unleſſe wee were perfectly ſanctified, but, that we muſt make conſcience of all Gods Commandements, even the leaſt. 2 It muſt bee total in reſpect of our ſelves: we muſt be wholly imployed in his ſervice, in all our parts and powers, the whole heart and all the ſtrength is here challenged. Wherein there is a notable difference between the ſervice wee owe to God, and that to men: Wee are to bee ſerviceable to men only in part, not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for the ſoul and Conſcience are not ſubject to men, which God eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially taketh up and looks for: Gods priviledge it is, to bee <hi>the father of spirits:</hi> for although wee take our bodies from our Parents, yet our ſouls are immediately from God: Men therefore have no power and authority over our ſouls, but God hath power both over ſoul and body, and is the Lord of our conſcience and ſpirit: and therefore of due muſt we ſubject our ſelves wholly in his ſervice.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. God ruleth his ſervice in reſpect of the end, which is twofold, <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40284:123"/> &amp; termini.</hi> 1 The proper aym and end of our ſervice muſt be, 1 Gods glory directly. If all our ſervice of men muſt be for God (as we ſaw it muſt) much more muſt Gods immediate ſervice. 2 The good of our brethren and of Gods Church, which we muſt not ſcandalize, but build up: for God will be ſerved in our ſervice of men. 2 Wee muſt ſerve our God without end: he requires ſuch an heart in his people, as to fear him <hi>always,</hi> Deut. 5.29. and 6.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſerve the Lord,</hi> and <hi>cleave unto him.</hi> Wee allow not our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to caſt up our work, and make holy-day at their pleaſure: much leſs moſt Gods ſervants think it lawful at any time to give any ſervice to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Sin, Luſt, the World, or any Creature, againſt the Will of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> This ſhould provoke us to tender unto God this ſervice with heart and good will, thus ſquared by God for the matter, manner, and ends of it. The Apoſtle (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.5, 6, 7, 8.) perſwadeth ſervants to obey their Maſters according to the fleſh, by three arguments, all which are much more ſtrong to perſwade our ſervice to our Maſter in heaven: Firſt (ſaith he) <hi>it is the will of God;</hi> Gods inſtitution, and the ordinance of Chriſt. It is enough for a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to know that ſuch a thing is the ordinate will of his own Maſter. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon of the Apoſtle, is taken from the honour of their ſervice, that in ſerving men they <hi>ſerved the Lord Chriſt,</hi> which was an honourable thing. Now we ſerve a great Lord, and as good as great. If a ſervant were bound to a wicked and froward Maſter, he muſt obey him in all lawful things: How much more are we to yeeld ſervice to ſo good a Lord, who can command no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which is moſt juſt, holy, and honourable? Hee ſets us not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any baſe or ignoble ſervice, to work in brick or clay, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but our work is the practice of piety and righteouſneſs, of prayer and praiſe. And beſides it is moſt beneficial to our ſelves: for, what gaineth he by our ſervice? <hi>our goodneſs reacheth not to him,</hi> to adde a grain to his perfection. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.9, 10. <hi>I will take no Bullock out of thy houſe: for all the beaſts of the foreſt are mine, and the ſheep on a thouſand mountains: If I were hungry, I would not tell thee.</hi> But it is our honour and profit; as when a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man takes a poor Sneak near him to ſerve him, ſuch a mean man is more honoured and pleaſured, than the noble man to whom he retains. The third reaſon of the Apoſtle, is drawn from the expectation of reward or wages, which, if their Maſters ſhould fail, God would not fail to repend unto them: <hi>knowing, that whatſoever good thing any man doth that ſame he ſhall receive of the Lord.</hi> Now if the Lord ſo liberally reward faithful ſervice done to mean, and even wicked men, how rich and royal a reward gives hee to the faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of himſelf? It gifts then may move us to ſerve God, the Lord truly ſaith, <hi>All theſe doe I give thee,</hi> and more alſo, my Chriſt, my Spirit, my ſelf, and life eternal. No man gives ſuch wages, no ſervant ever had ſuch a pay-maſter.</p>
                     <p>To theſe might be added ſundry other motives: as, 1 To ſerve God, is to reign, and to be a King over the world, fleſhly luſts, &amp;c. and to ſuit with Saints and Angels. 2 God hereby becomes our protector, maintainer, and revenge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40284:123"/> us be ready to hear, not lightly abſent, nor preſent for cuſtom, but conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. 2 Let us ſerve him in affection, and be glad to doe any thing to pleaſe him, and grieve when we fail either in doing that wee ſhould not, or in not doing that we ought, or not in that manner that may pleaſe the Lord. 3 Be ever imployed in his work: How know I a mans ſervant, but by his labouring in his Maſters buſineſs? <hi>Yee are his ſervant to whom yee obey,</hi> Rom. 6.16. and Joh. 15. <hi>Yee are my Diſciples, if yee doe whatſoever I command you.</hi> If I ſee a man ſpend his time in the ſervice of ſin, of luſts, of games, pleaſure, the world, &amp;c.

A good ſervant knows his time and ſtrength is his Maſters, and hee muſt bee profitable to him, and ſeek his credit. It will be with every ſervant of Chriſt as with <hi>Oneſimus, Phileus.</hi> 11. being converted: howſoever before grace he were ſo unprofitable and pilfering, as he was unfit for any honeſt mans houſe, and much more the houſe of God, yet now he profits the Lord, and credits him, and takes not his meat, and drink, and wages for nothing, 5 A good ſervant ſets forward his Maſters work in others, hee will provoke his fellow-ſervants, and not ſmite and hinder them, as <hi>the evil ſervant</hi> did: he will defend his Lord, he will venture his life for him, he will ſtand alſo for his fellow-ſervants, while they are in their Maſters buſineſs; he will be a law to himſelf, if there were no Law, no Diſcipline; he will not idle out his time; his eye is upon the eye of his Maſter, his mind upon his account, his endeavour to pleaſe him in all things.</p>

                     <p>Wee are in the Church militant, beſet with our enemies ſo long as wee live, and can wee expect victory without blows? or think wee our ſelves ſafe and free, when wee have ſtood out one skirmiſh, or two, ſeeing our enemies are alive, and ever renewing the aſſault? No: let us reſolve to the contrary with the Apoſtle, and ſay, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, from henceforth is laid up for me a crown of glory, which the righteous judge ſhall give mee at that day.</hi> Wages are given at the end of a work, and an earneſt only in the beginning.</p>

Laſtly, as Chriſts temptation ſhews what condition wee are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, ſo his Victory aſſures us of ours, and ſhews what ſhall bee the end of our temptations. In mens battels the Victory is doubtful, here it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; in them the ſtronger for the moſt part overcomes, here the weaker, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are armed with the ſame power as Chriſt was. Here is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the godly and the wickeds temptations: God leads the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into temptations, and then leaves them; hee leads the godly in, but he leads them out alſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Then the Devil left him]</hi> namely, when hee had been every way reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when hee could faſten nothing upon the Son of God, when neither penury and want, nor temptation to vain-glory, nor to Covetouſneſs could move him, then hee gives over.

                        </label> ſhall bee alſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the members, ſeing the reſiſtance of Chriſt was not only for himſelf, but for his members. Let no man ſay, It is true, the Devil is that ſtrong man, but Chriſt is ſtronger than hee, that binds him and makes him flye; but alas! what is that to me a weakling, who dare not look my enemy in the face? For as our Saviour comforteth his Diſciples againſt the malice of the world, ſo alſo may we be comforted againſt the malice of the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>ult. Bee of good comfort, I have overcome the world;</hi> which had been but a cold comfort to them, had not they ſhared with him in his own victory. Which is alſo infinite in power, and in time.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The promiſe of God is, that if wee reſiſt Satan, hee ſhall flye by vertue of which promiſe the Devil is overcome and put to flight, by the weakeſt member of Chriſt, manfully reſiſting him: for it is not the ſtrength or worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our reſiſtance that can daunt the Devil, but becauſe God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to tread down Satan under our feet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.19. therefore by reſiſting wee muſt tread upon him, not that our reſiſtance is a cauſe, but onely a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40284:125"/> means, in which God gives Victory. God promiſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and power to ſubdue all thoſe Nations then poſſeſſors of it; by vertue of which promiſe, if five Kings at once riſe up againſt <hi>Joſhua,</hi> hee muſt tread upon all their necks: it was not their power that did this, though they muſt uſe means, and raiſe all their power againſt them, but Gods promiſe: Say not in thine heart, <hi>By my own hand, or ſtrength, or wiſdome, have I taken this good land: no, it was becauſe God loved thee: It was the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> So here.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Satan cannot but flye if hee bee reſiſted, becauſe hee is a conquered e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, ſpoiled of his weapons which were moſt mortal: and not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered in Chriſt our head, but in us his members: for, to whom was that promiſe made, but to the Church, that <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head?</hi> ſo as his head is broken to myſtical Chriſt, whole Chriſt both the head and the members; let him now nibble at the heel, and hiſs, and gape, and flye upon them, hee cannot hurt them, becauſe his ſting is taken away. Now what can conquered enemies do if they bee ſtill reſiſted, but flye?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The battel which wee fight is the Lords, wherein hee will not bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: the ſtrength is the Lords, who is mighty in battel. What was the ſtrength of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Goliah?</hi> but when hee comes againſt him in the name of <hi>the Lord,</hi> a ſmall and weak reſiſtance overthrows him. Our armour is the Lords; <hi>Put on the armour of God.</hi> And it is armour of proof: It were a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to his workmanſhip if it ſhould ever bee found ſlight or inſufficient. Our cauſe is the Lords, a contention <hi>for the faith:</hi> Fight <hi>the good fight of faith,</hi> which ſhall prevail againſt all the gates of Hell. Our Captain was never overcome, nor can bee, nor any one of his fellows: for they are all members of that body, whereof hee is the head; and can a Head able to ſave the Body, ſuffer it ſelf to bee diſ-membred of any one member? Our Aiders and Aſſiſtance that come in to help us while wee reſiſt, are the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who have a charge to keep us in our waies, and give us ſtrength and victory: they bee too ſtrong for Satan and all his powers, and they bee more that be with us than they againſt us.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But are not many of Gods Children not onely ſore thruſt at, but even overcome in temptation? Nay, and doth not experience ſhew, that the more the child of God reſiſteth, the more Satan aſſaulteth him? And doth not another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teach us, that the leſſe hee is reſiſted, the ſooner hee flies, and is leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> God in great wiſdome ſuffers Satan to moleſt his dear Children, and infeſt them with long and ſtrong temptations, and many times to foil them, and to renew his temptations, and the battel day by day: 1 For their humbling and exerciſe, the Lord deſtroyed not all the <hi>Canaanites</hi> before <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but left ſome people to hold them battel, <hi>leſt they ſhould grow ſecure, Judg.</hi> 3.1. and to teach them battel: And <hi>Paul</hi> muſt bee buffeted by Satan, <hi>leſt hee ſhould bee exalted by the multitude of Revelations.</hi> 2 To make them more watchful of their Graces, and keep cloſe their Faith, Hope, Love, Patience, &amp;c. as when Robbers, and Pilferers are abroad, men ſhut up and lock their goods within; ſo here. 3 To magnify his own glory, who manifeſteth ſuch power in ſuch weakneſs, and ſeaſonably ſets in for their ſafety and victory, when in their ſenſe they are utterly loſt.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 Satan indeed often aſſaulteth where hee is much reſiſted: for hee will
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40284:125"/> ſtill renew the battel: <hi>Sometimes</hi> in ſtrong Chriſtians, whom the Lord preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth forth as the Leaders in his battel, for, <hi>ſtrength is for the war. Job</hi> reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but was ſtill aſſaulted, becauſe his meaſure of ſtrength was ſuch as was to bee a pattern to all ordinary men. Our Lord had reſiſted Satan once and again, but till now hee flies not, becauſe hee was to bee the General of the field, on whom all muſt look as an example, and for direction. But the iſſue is, that Satan ſhall flye at length; and the longer and ſtronger his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, the more God glorifieth himſelf both in the victory of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and confuſion of the Devil, as wee ſee in both the former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sometimes</hi> hee fiercely aſſaileth weaker Chriſtians, who are eaſilier pulled from their holds for want of knowledge, judgement, or reſolution: theſe hee thinks will bee tyred out with importunity, and hee hopes to force them to yeeld at length. And ſurely many weaker ones invite Satans temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unawares, which toil them worſe than death, becauſe they are ſo flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Satan ſometimes hears them ſpeak in his own Language; Thou art an Hypocrite, a great ſinner above all men; ſometimes hee ſees them uſe his weapons againſt themſelves, and ſo give way to the Adverſary in ſtead of reſiſting, whereas ſtout and manful reſiſtance would ſpeedily procure their peace: ſometimes for want of judgement they are not able to diſtinguiſh of Satans ſins from their own, but carry themſelves as they would take upon themſelves the Devils reckoning. Alaſs! All this invites him, and makes him welcome. But here let the weakeſt Beleever know, that if hee reſiſt lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee ſhall carry away the victory, let his reſiſtance bee never ſo weak; and this ſhall make for Gods greater glory, and Satans greater confuſion, that hee is not able to ſtand out the field againſt the weakeſt of them, whom hee may ſeem to ſcorn. It was a great confuſion, that Satan was not able to ſtand againſt Chriſt himſelf: but that hee ſhall not be able to ſtand againſt a ſinner, a worm, which turns again in the name of Chriſt, is greater confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion than the former.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Whereas Satan ſeems quiet where hee is leaſt reſiſted, it is no marvel, his Kingdome is not divided againſt himſelf. What need a Captain bend his Forces againſt a Town, which hath delivered up it ſelf into his hand? What need hee ſet bul-warks and Canon-ſhot againſt thoſe Walls and gates which are willingly ſet open? <hi>When the strong man keeps the hold, all things are at peace.</hi> But a miſerable peace it is, to run from under the colours of the Prince of peace, to go ſo peaceably and gently to the dungeon of eternal darkneſs?</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This may comfort the child of God, that hee ſhall out-ſtand all his temptations: it is not onely poſſible for him to overcome the Devil, and put him to flight, but alſo certain. For, <hi>The juſt man falleth ſeven times a day, but riſeth again, Prov.</hi> 24.16. And why? 1 Becauſe Gods election is eternal, and unchangeable, and his foundation ſure. 2 Becauſe of Chriſts prayer, <hi>that our faith might not fail.</hi> 3 Becauſe the godly man hath built his <hi>houſe on a rock,</hi> againſt which the windes may blow, and the floods beat, but it ſhall ſtand: and hee is ſet into that head, who overcame the Tempter, that hee might overcome him alſo. 4 Becauſe of the promiſe that God will not forſake his Child overlong, but ſupply ſtrength for the combate, and give a gracious iſſue. And temptation prevails only when God addes not a ſecond grace, but ſtandeth afar off.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, juſtly, when hee remitted of his watch and reſiſtance; but this was neither totally nor finally. The reaſon is, becauſe God puts a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Devil two waies: 1 Abſolutely: 2 With limitation. <hi>Abſolutely,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.16</note> as when his juſtice gives up a wicked man to bee wholly <hi>ruled
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40284:126"/> at his will,</hi> and carried head-long to deſtruction. <hi>With limitation,</hi> when a man is put into his hand to prevail over him to a certain meaſure, as <hi>Job,</hi> and our Saviour to be in theſe temptations carried and moleſted, to a certain meaſure of time and vexation. Thus the Lord ſometimes for a time leaveth his own Children into the hand of Satan, ſo as he may tempt them, and prevail over them to the committing of fearful ſins, as we ſee in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> which ſins often blind and harden them, and damp their conſcience, that for a time they ſee no diſpleaſure of God, but lye ſecure and impenitent, as <hi>David</hi> well-nigh a year.</p>
                     <p>But all this deſertion of God was to a certain meaſure: at length the cloud was gone, the miſt diſperſed, the light returned, Satan reſiſted, and forced to fly away. And this is the ground of that prayer of <hi>David,</hi> and the Saints, <hi>Lord, forſake me not over-long:</hi> not fearing that the Lord would quite take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his grace from him (as the violent <hi>Lutherans</hi> teach) but that hee ſhould not with-draw his ſecond grace over-farre, or over-much: Which prayer is grounded on a promiſe of God, by vertue whereof wee may conclude, that the battel of Beleevers is not for the over-throw, but the exerciſe of their faith.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 Faith in Gods promiſes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. — whom reſiſt <hi>ſtedfaſt in the faith;</hi> Chriſt here ſets himſelf ſtedfaſtly in the word of his Father, and ſo conquers the Devil. <hi>The victory that overcomes the world, is by faith to lean on the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God.</hi> Faith keeps in ſight Chriſt our victorious Captain, and ſets the crown of life in our eye, which is laid up for them that are faithful to the death.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Prayer joyned with faſting and watching. Chriſt entring this combate armed himſelf with faſting, watching, and prayer, for many days together.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40284:126"/> 
                        <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Goliah</hi> drew near, took a ſtone out of his ſcrip, and ſmote him in the fore-head that he fell down: This ſtone that overthrows the helliſh <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> is prayer. While <hi>Moſes</hi> hands are lifted up, all the Armies of the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> fly before <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And St. <hi>James</hi> in his Epiſtle tells us, that if wee would reſiſt the Devil, we muſt draw near God, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. and never doe wee draw nearer God, than in effectual and fervent prayer. Let the Diſciples uſe any means without this, the Devil will not fly; whereof if they ask the reaſon, Chriſt tells them, the <hi>Devil is not caſt out but by faſting and prayer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 The practice of true godlineſs, and reſolution againſt all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Righteouſneſs is called a <hi>breſt-plate,</hi> Epheſ. 6.14. which is not only that imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but that inherent righteouſneſs of our ſelves, which is the ſtudy and endeavour in a godly life: and the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> among other directions, in reſiſting the Devil, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. giveth this for one, <hi>Cleanſe your hearts yee ſinners, and purge your hearts yee wavering minded:</hi> and the reaſon is good, ſeeing by every ſin and luſt being nouriſhed, Satan is let in, and the yeelding to any corruption is to give him ſo much ground, in ſtead of beating him out of our borders. He that is in a fight, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaineth from whatſoever would hinder him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. and therefore from ſin, which preſſeth down, and hangeth faſt on. Let us meditate on that Law, Deut. 23.9 <hi>When thou goeſt out againſt thine enemies to fight, abſtain from every evil thing.</hi> For this weakens us, and turns God againſt us, and drives his good Angels from us.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Gods Spirit: <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might:</hi> our own ſtrength will eaſily be turned againſt us, our own counſels cannot but caſt us down. God reſiſteth the proud, and aſſiſteth the humble. As therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the red ſea, being naked and weak, not knowing what to doe, ſo may we in this caſe, <hi>Stand still, fear not, behold the ſalvation of the Lord:</hi> Grieve not the Spirit, nor quench his motions, who is the Spirit of power, of wiſdome, of fortitude, and counſel, of ſtrength, and direction: and goe forth in the boldneſs of that Spirit, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.11. <hi>The Lord is with me like a mighty gyant,</hi> therefore mine enemies ſhall be overthrown, and ſhall not prevail, but ſhall be mightily confounded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> the good manner of reſiſting the Devil that hee may fly, is this:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Reſiſt the firſt temptation, and break the Serpents head, daſh the heads of <hi>Babylons</hi> brood againſt the ſtones. Wiſe men will not let the enemy come near the walls, or the gates, much leſs into the Market-place. It is a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to give the foyl at the firſt on-ſet. Give <hi>no place</hi> to the Devil, give ſin no room in thy heart, or if Satan inwardly ſuggeſt any, there cloſe it up, let it dye and never come out, as a man that hath a Serpent in a veſſel, ſtops it up, and there it dyes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Reſiſt the leaſt evil motion, contemn not the leaſt temptation, for Satan can tell how by one grain of poyſon to kill the ſoul, and by one dead fly to corrupt a whole box of oyntment. The weakeſt man, yea or woman, is ſtrong enough to kill a ſleepy <hi>Siſera,</hi> The weakeſt temptation is too ſtrong for a careleſs and ſecure adverſary. <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould have reſiſted Satan in an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and <hi>Lots</hi> wife in a look. No ſin is ſo light and venial, that is not worth reſiſtance. For Satan can uſe ſmall ſins as the Fiſher uſeth ſmall hairs to hold the Fiſh as faſt, or faſter, than greater tackling, and ſecret ſins to doe more harm in the ſoul than open.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Reſiſt ſtoutly and manfully: if he pull one way, pull thou the other, for ſo doth he that reſiſts. If he tempt thee to pride, incline thou ſo much the more to humility. If he move thee to revenge, provoke thy ſelf to meekneſs and patience. If he tempt thee to earthlineſs, bend thou thy ſelf ſo much the more
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40284:127"/> to heavenly-mindedneſs: and thus thou ſhalt beat him with his own weapons, and take off <hi>Goliahs</hi> head with his own ſword, and all his gain in tempting thee, ſhall be to ſet thee faſter and nearer unto God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Reſiſt conſtantly to the laſt: though thou be ſore aſſayled, and ready to forſake the field, yet reſiſt ſtill though never ſo weakly. Conſider that Chriſt promiſeth a place on his Throne only to <hi>him that overcometh,</hi> Revel. 3.21. and that there is no ſafety in flying, no peice of armour appointed for the back, If thou beeſt greatly ſtraightned, ſend Satan to the ctoſs of Chriſt, there he ſhal receive an anſwer: but rather dye manfully than fly cowardly. By flying thou loſeſt the victory, by dying thou canſt not.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Reſiſt after victory, when Satan ſeems not to reſiſt; hold on thy har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and expect the enemy when he ſeems abſent; perhaps her feigns himſelf foyled, when he is but renewing his aſſault, or as a Pirate hangs out a flag of truce to board us, or diſſembles a flight to draw us out of our holds, and then hath an ambuſhment againſt us; and this is his ſoreſt fight: or he will ſeem of yeeld the victory to them, whom he knows cannot tell how to uſe it, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will grow proud of it, or ſecure, and lay off their watch, and then, whom he could not in warre overcome while he was reſiſted, in their peace he ſpoyls them, when they think he needs no reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This reproves the idle conceit of men, who think to be ſafe from the Devil without reſiſtance; as, 1 Many ignorant men, who will ſpit at the mention of the Devil, and bleſs themſelves from the ſoul Fiend, and yet are ſure enough in his power: theſe never knew what it meant to reſiſt the Devil; they want knowledge in the word, and are willingly and wilfully ignorant; they want faith, and never inquire after it: they live according to Nature, and the faſhion and cuſtom of the times, are ordinary Swearers, and Sabbath-breakers, and worldlings, and they think it was never well ſince there was ſo much preaching. And for the Spirit of God, if hee were not preſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them with common grace, it were no living near them; but for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Spirit, to ſet them out of Satans power, and the corruption of their own ſins, hee is ſo farre from them, as they may ſay truly with <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.2. <hi>Wee know not whether there be an Holy Ghoſt or no.</hi> Alas, how pitiful is the ſtate of theſe men, who think Satan is fled from them, when hee is their only counſellour and familiar, ruling them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Many that think to reſiſt the Devil, but they are loath yet to diſeaſe either him or themſelves; yet a little while they will hold their ſins, they would fain provide for their wives and children, and riſe to ſuch an eſtate before they give up their covetouſneſs, uſury, deceitful and injurious courſes: they will leave their voluptuous and adulterous courſes, when they are old, that is, when theſe ſins muſt needs leave them; they will repent of their ſins when they dye, they would be loath to carry them to Gods Judgement with them; but ſo long as they live, their ſin ſhall live with them. Fye upon ſuch madneſs: Are old decrepit men fit for the field? Is a man upon his death-bed a fit man to maſter a Gyant? Shall a man ſo be-fool himſelf, as to think that then he can eaſieſt reſiſt the Devil, when his power is leaſt? No, no: Satan will now triumph and trample upon his ſpoyl; he knows well, that not one of ten thouſand lets his ſin live ſo long with him, but his repentance dyes with him alſo.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Others dream of a victory over the Devil, and they are ſafe, but they are not ſo ſtrict as not to yeeld ſome equal conditions to their adverſary, they care not to give a little place unto him. They are no great ſwearers by great oathes, but now and then they may forget themſelves, and ſay <hi>by God,</hi> or <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>troth,</hi> &amp;c. Nor great gameſters that live by gaming, but now and then ſit out a number of hours together, to ſpend and paſs away their times.</p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:40284:127"/>
                     <p>Not great drinkers, but onely give Satan advantages by running into ſuch Company and Houſes as they may bee provoked to drink a little more than they need. Nor open contemners of the word and Prayer, to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and make their mindes known; but they cannot abide this ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at home. Is not the Church the houſe of Prayer? Nor known Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, they are honeſt of their bodies, but their eyes are full of Adultery, and their mouthes full of obſcene filthy ſpeeches, yet they ſay they think no hurt. This is to dally with the Devil, as friends at foils, that have caps on the points of their rapiers for fear of hurting one another. Here is no ſpirit ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but hee that rules in the World. The Devil flyes not for ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>III. Then the Devil left him.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Namely, when Chriſt bad him be gone. Whence wee may note: that,</p>
                     <p>Doct, <hi>The power of Chriſt is ſuch, as all the Devils in Hell are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</hi> If Chriſt bid the Devil avoid, even then at his word hee muſt bee pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Mark. 9.25. hee <hi>charged the unclean ſpirit to come out, and enter no more into the man, ſo as the Devils cryed for grief and anger:</hi> Mark. 1.34. <hi>a whole le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Devils ſubmiſſively entreat him not to torment them.</hi> And this was not onely ſo in it ſelf, but in the knowledge of all the Jews, who brought all that were poſſeſſed with Devils, and hee healed them: <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.28. the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naaniteſh</hi> woman ſeeking to Chriſt for her Daughter, that was poſſeſſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged thereby that his power was above all the Devils: and our Lord moſt notably in that ſtory manifeſted his power over them, who being abſent from the maid, and did not ſo much as ſpeak to the Devils, yet they obeyed his will, and could as little withſtand his power being abſent as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                     <p>Now more diſtinctly to know this power of Chriſt, wee muſt underſtand that it is either twofold: 1 Of his eſſence, called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: or 2 Of his Office, called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The former, is the omnipotency of Chriſt, as hee is God equal with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt: for as his eſſence (us the Son) is the ſame, ſo is his power, an abſolute, creating, ſuſtaining, and commanding power, ruling all Creatures, and over-ruling in all things. The latter, is the power of his Office, as hee is Mediatour and King of his Church: and this power differeth from the former: 1 in that it is a power received, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given mee in heaven and in earth:</hi> Phil. 2.9. <hi>God hath given him a Name above all Names:</hi> whereas Chriſts power, as God, is not received, but his own proper power being God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That power is eſſential, infinite, and incommunicable to any creature: this is perſonal, communicated by diſpenſation of grace, after a ſingular manner, unto Chriſt, as God-man, and our Mediatour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That power is immutable, unchangeable, everlaſting; this power ſhall after a ſort bee determined: for <hi>hee muſt give up his Kingdome to his Father,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. not that Chriſt ſhall ever ceaſe to bee a powerful head of his Church, nor that hee ſhall ceaſe to reign with his Father for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: but look as the Father now doth not rule the Church, namely, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, but the Son; ſo the Son ſhall not then rule his Church in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as hee now doth, as Mediatour, but in the ſame manner as his Father ſhall. Now hee rules and puts forth his power in fighting againſt his enemies, but then all his enemies ſhall bee trodden under his feet, and made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool. Now hee manifeſteth his power in gathering a Church by the Word and Sacraments, but then all the elect ſhall bee gathered. Now at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right hand hee puts forth his power in making interceſſion for us, but then hee ſhall intercede no more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> us. At the end of the World, hee ſhall declare his mighty power, in raiſing all the dead, and ſitting in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them; but then there ſhall bee no more need of this power,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40284:128"/> when death ſhall bee ſwallowed up into victory, and a final ſentence is given on all fleſh. So as Chriſt ſhall not reign as now hee doth, but as his Father.</p>
                     <p>Whence it followeth, that the power by which Chriſt ſubdueth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, is not onely that eſſential power of his Divine nature, but the power of his Office, whereby even in our nature and fleſh, hee ſubdueth them. And this power may bee diſtinguiſhed according to the ſubjects, into two kindes: firſt, that power by which hee ſweetly ruleth the Church, as the head the members, or a King his Subjects: and this is either directive, or coercive. Secondly, that coercitive and judiciary power which hee exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth againſt his enemies, wicked and ungodly men, as a King againſt rebells and foes to his ſtate and perſon. And this power is properly raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devils and his inſtruments, againſt which they cannot ſtand.</p>

                     <p>Object. <hi>But did not others beſide Chriſt command the Devils?</hi> Act. 8.7. <hi>when</hi> Philip <hi>preached in</hi> Samaria, <hi>unclean ſpirits crying came out of many: and</hi> Act. 16.18.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Chriſt did it by his own power, they by his. 2 The power of Chriſt is one thing, faith in his power is another; they did it not ſo much by power, as by faith in this power: whence S. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth the foul ſpirit, <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to come out:</hi> 3 Common men were able to diſcern a difference between Chriſts power and others in caſting out Devils: <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.36. fear came on them, and they ſaid among themſelves, <hi>With authority he commands foul ſpirits, and they come out;</hi> that is, by his power and divine authority, and not as other Exorciſts did. 4 Hee did work his as a perſon that was God, other his Diſciples as perſons with whom God was, working and <hi>confirming the doctrin with ſignes and wonders that followed,</hi> Mar. 16. ult.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 All things are given him, and put under his feet. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.35. The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> loveth the <hi>Son,</hi> and hath given all things into his hand. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8. Thou haſt <hi>put all things in ſubjection</hi> under his feet. And as if that were not plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, hee ſetteth in the next words a large Comment upon it. And in that he hath put <hi>all things</hi> in ſubjection under him, he left nothing that ſhould not be ſubject, only except him which did put all things under him, as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. So as it is plain, that excepting God himſelf, nothing is not ſubject to Chriſt as Mediatour.</p>
                     <p>Now this may bee enlarged by a ſpecial induction of all things. Angels are ſubjected to his word: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. — <hi>to whom Angels, and Powers, and might, are ſubject:</hi> with a reaſon, <hi>For hee is the Lord of the holy Angels, and ſet far above all Principalities and Powers, Eph.</hi> 1.21. Unreaſonable Creatures hear his word, and obey him: <hi>Luke</hi> 8.25. <hi>Who is this that commands the winds and the Seas, and they obey him?</hi> Diſeaſes obey him: to the Leper hee ſaith, <hi>I will, bee thou clean:</hi> and hee is clean immediately, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. To the Lame man hee ſaith, <hi>Take up thy bed, and walk,</hi> and hee doth ſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.6. Hee meets a blind man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.7. and bids him go waſh in <hi>Siloam,</hi> and hee comes again ſeeing. Yea, death it ſelf heareth, and departeth at his word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.44. <hi>At that word</hi> Lazarus <hi>came forth, bound hand and foot: and the time commeth, when they that are in the graves, ſhall hear the voice of the Son of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40284:128"/> God, and come forth.</hi> In one word, the Apoſtle aſcribeth to Chriſt, <hi>that he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf,</hi> Phil. 3.21. All Creatures, all Enemies, ſin, Satan, the Grave, Hell, Death, Damnation, and whatſoever reſiſteth his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in himſelf, or any of his members.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Chriſts Kingdome muſt bee ſet up againſt, and above all the Kingdoms of the World. Dan. 2.45. <hi>The little ſtone cut out of the Mountain without hands,</hi> breaks in pieces the Clay, the Iron, Braſs, Silver, and gold: that is, the Kingdome of Chriſt ſhall break all thoſe great Kingdomes; and the God of Heaven raiſeth a Kingdome to his Son, which ſhall never bee deſtroyed: And therefore for the upholding of this Kingdome, hee muſt bee inveſted with power, which neither the Tyrants of the World, nor the god of the World can ever prevail againſt. For never were all the Kingdomes of the World ſo oppoſed by the World and the Devil, as the poor kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt: but this power of Chriſt is as an hook in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> jaws, and a chain in which hee holdeth <hi>Leviathan,</hi> limiting him how far he ſhall exerciſe malice againſt the Church, and no further.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Chriſt as Mediatour was to perform thoſe works, which no other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could ever do, and therefore was to bee indued with ſuch power as no other creature could bee capable of. Hence hee proveth himſelf to bee from God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.24. If I do not ſuch workes as no other man ever did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve mee not. Where hee ſpeaks of his Miracles, which, in reſpect of the manner and multitude, never man did the like in his own name, nor ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. To which adde thoſe great works, of raiſing himſelf by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. Of ſatiſfying Gods juſtice for mans ſin, a work above the reach of men and Angels. Of meriting eternal life for all the elect, which muſt bee an action of him that is more than a Creature. Of applying his merit, to which end hee muſt riſe from death, aſcend and make interceſſion. Of ſending his Spirit. Of begetting faith, and preſerving his people in grace received. Of leading them through Death and the Duſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own Glory. Theſe are ſuch things as all power of meer creatures is too weak for. All the Angels in Heaven cannot do the leaſt of them. All the Devils in Hell cannot hinder them. And hence Chriſt is ſtiled the <hi>Lyon of the Tribe of</hi> Judah, Michael, <hi>the mighty God, King of glory, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This may bee a terror to all Chriſt enemies: for ſuch is his power as ſhall make them all his footſtool. Do wee provoke him? are wee ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than hee? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9. thoſe that will not bee ſubject to the rod of his mouth, ſhall bee cruſhed with a rod of Iron. Therefore take heed of being an enemy to Chriſt, or his Word, or Servants: elſe thou ſhalt bee revenged even in that wherein thou ſinneſt; with the breath of his lips hee ſhall ſlay the wicked; one word of Chriſt, one <hi>lie</hi> ſhall turn them all into Hell. Is the power of Jeſus Chriſt ſuch in his baſe and low eſtate, as all the Devils in Hell are not able to reſiſt it, but if hee ſpeak the word they give place? how deſperately do wicked men go on in ſin, as if they were able to make their part good againſt him? <hi>Joh.</hi> 18 6. when Chriſt but ſaid, <hi>I am</hi> he, preſently his apprehenders fell to the ground. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. <hi>they ſhall fight againſt the Lamb, but the Lamb ſhall overcome.</hi>

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40284:129"/> that hee might bee able to ſuccour them that are tempted. Not corporal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: Hee by his power ruleth in the midſt of his enemies. <hi>Laban</hi> ſhall not ſpeak a rough word, nor <hi>Eſau</hi> hurt <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor <hi>Saul</hi> hit <hi>David;</hi> for hee orders the thing otherwiſe. Not the grave: for wee have the aſſurance of a glorious reſurrection by the working of his mighty power, whereby hee is able to ſubdue all things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. Not hell it ſelf: <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. I have the keys of Hell and of Death. In one word, not any thing preſent, nor to come, nothing ſhall ſeparate between Chriſt and us: none ſhall pluck us out of his hands: for hee hath purchaſed for us, and maintaineth a mighty ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This teacheth us to ſubmit our ſelves to this power of Chriſt, or elſe wee are worſe than ſenſleſs Creatures, who all obey him, yea, than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils themſelves who did obey him. And then is a man ſubmitted to it, when is eyes are opened to ſee what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power in himſelf, beleeving as the Apoſtle prayeth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. Therefore labour to find Chriſts ſaving power in thy ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How may I find it in my ſelf?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 If thou canſt finde the work of faith in thee, a work of great power, a ſupernatural work, beyond, yea, againſt the ſtrength of nature. What a work of omnipotence is it to raiſe the dead? yet greater power is here, to bring in this life of God into him that is dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, reſiſting his own raiſing: for ſo the Apoſtle implyeth in that place, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If thou canſt finde in thee the work of ſanctification, which is a work of great power: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. according to his Divine power he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth grace and glory. This ſecond creation of a man goes far beyond his firſt in power: There was nothing to begin with, no more is here; no life of God till God call the things that are not, as though they were: but there was a bare privation, here is a reſiſtance and rebellion, ſtiff necks, and hearts of adamant. Hence regeneration is called a creation, and the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, new creatures: But a difficult work, which God works not alone, but God and man made one perſon, and not of nothing, for nothing, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but of worſe than nothing, and for a price, even the precious blood of the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>Labour to find this change in thy ſelf by faith and holineſs. Chriſt did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more manifeſt his power, than by raiſing himſelf from the dead: and thou canſt not have a ſurer argument of Chriſts power prevailing in thy ſoul, than by getting daily out of the grave of ſin, and moving according to the life of God. So ſoon as Chriſt had called <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of his grave, hee bad looſe him and let him go; and if thou findeſt the bands of death, thine own ſins looſed, forſaking thy own evil waies, it is a ſign that Chriſt by a powerful word hath quickened thee. Therefore put on S. <hi>Pauls</hi> minde, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. who counted all things dung to know the vertue of Chriſt his death.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 A mighty work of power in Chriſt is, to gather his Church out of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and nations, and to bring them within one roof, though they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo diſperſed and alienated from one another, and to knit them by faith to himſelf the head, by love one to another, and by his own diſcipline to conform them to his own government. It never coſt all the Monarchs in the World ſo much ſtrength and power to ſettle their Kingdomes and people in peace under them. Doeſt thou then finde thy ſelf brought into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gods people? Doeſt thou love them entirely for Gods image and goodneſs? Art thou ſerviceable to every member, and that in the Head? Here is a power put forth that hath reconciled the Woolf and the Lamb,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 11.6, 7</note> the Child and the Cockatrice. But it thou careſt not for Chriſts Ordinances and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40284:129"/> diſcipline, his Laws are too ſtrict, thou muſt have more liberty than hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, if thy affections be rough and ſtirring againſt Gods children, thou haſt not yet ſubjected thy ſelf to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 A mighty work of power in Chriſt was, that he was able to ſoyl temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſtand out againſt all helliſh powers, ſo that the Devil <hi>found nothing in him:</hi> Now findeſt thou the power and ſtrength of Chriſt in the ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate? Doeſt thou chaſe Satan afore thee, and the whole band of his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Wouldeſt thou refuſe a whole world rather than ſin againſt God, or gratifie Satan and thy ſelf with the leaſt diſpleaſure of him? All the power of Chriſt was ſet againſt ſin, and Satans Kingdom: And if thou haſt part in this power of Chriſt, it aboliſheth ſin in thee, and ſtrengthneth thee with full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution againſt all ſin.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 A mighty work of Chriſts power is, to enrich his children with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary graces tending to ſalvation, and to lead them into the fruition of their eternal inheritance. It coſt <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſome labour before he could bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the good Land that abounded with good things: it coſt our <hi>JOSHUA</hi> more. Findeſt thou this fruit of Chriſts power, that thy face is ſet towards Heaven? and is it with thee as with thoſe that entred into that good Land, who taſted of the fruits aforehand? Haſt thou received the firſt fruits of the Spirit? Doeſt thou grow in grace? Doeſt thou with patience expect the promiſes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the heavenly life already? Haſt thou hope, joy, love of God, zeal for God, conſtancy in the truth? for theſe are purchaſed by this power of Chriſt. Then here is a creating vertue put forth, a fruit of Chriſts mighty power, magnifie this grace of God, and hope for the accompliſhment and finiſhing of the ſame work by the ſame power, the which ſhall preſerve thee to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 A mighty work of Chriſts power was, the perfect fulfilling of the Law. Whether doeſt thou partake in this power? art thou <hi>perfect in the way?</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely obeying God in all his Commandements? Doeſt thou ſubject thy ſelf to the Law as the rule of thy Law? Doeſt thou aym at the perfection thereof? Chriſt loved his Father with all his heart, and his Neighbour as himſelf, yea above himſelf: and if this power of Chriſt prevail with thee, this will bee the ſcope and aym of all thy actions. For though the obedience of the Law bee not neceſſary to Juſtification, yet it is requiſite to Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Another work of Chriſts power was, that it ſet him free from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and infirmities, which hee undertook for us without ſin. Labour to finde this power of Chriſt in thy ſoul, daily freeing thee from the corruption of thy ſin, and daily infirmities. If the Son ſet you free, you are free indeed: not only the reign of ſin is thruſt down, but the corruption of ſin is leſſned. <hi>David</hi> deſired the Lord to give him again his <hi>free Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 51.10, 11. he well knew, that <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> that is, not only a redemption from Damnation by our juſtification, but from corruption and vain converſation by our ſanctification.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Chriſts power was mighty in ruling and ordering his own powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; his underſtanding was able to ſee God perfectly, his will only juſt, right, and wiſe, never bowing from the will of his Father, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> His memory could never forget any good thing, but he retained his whole duty ever before him. His affections were ordered according to right judgement. His appetite never exceeded the bounds of ſobriety and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. His ſpeech was gracious, his actions all exemplary, no ſpot in him from top to toe. And this ſame power of Chriſt is in ſome meaſure manifeſt in all his members: this power enlightneth the minds of beleevers, formerly blind, to ſee God in part, and perſwadeth the will, and boweth it to obey Gods will, which before was captivated to the will of the Devil: it inſpireth
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40284:130"/> godly deſires and gracious reſolutions, and ſtrengthens the memory to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good things, being before as rimy as a five: it guideth and altereth the affections, making the beleever to love good things, and good men, and whatſoever ſets forward Gods glory, and to hate zealouſly the contrary. Chriſts power in the ſoul, orders the appetite to ſobriety in the ſeaſonable and thankful uſe of outward mercies, makes a man ſpeak the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and his whole courſe ſavour of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Whence it is plainly concluded, that ignorant perſons, malicious perſons, Libertines, intemperate Drunkards, Gluttons, filthy talkers, Swearers, looſe in their behaviour, open enemies to this power of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to the rod of his mouth, ſhall bee laid under his rod of iron.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. This teacheth us to goe on fearleſly in good duties, ſeeing this power of Chriſt is with us, and for us. He is of power to protect us againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and dangers. Of power to ſtrengthen us in our duties; when we are weak and feeble he will perfect his power in our weakneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. Of power to make us invincible in our ſufferings, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can doe all things through him that inableth me.</hi> Of power to reward our leaſt labour of love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for him. Of power to anſwer our prayers, and to doe abundantly above all we ask or think. Of power to perform all his gracious promiſes, which ſhall be made good to us in due time. Of power to ſupply us with all good means in his ſervice; hee can give wealth, and make the latter end bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as he did to <hi>Job: the Divine power giveth all things pertaining to life and godlineſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.3. Of power in death it ſelf to keep that which wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto him till the laſt day. Of power to rebuke Diſeaſes, and command Death, and after death to raiſe our bodies to eternal life, being cloathed with corruption, and wrapped with deaths garments: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. God hath raiſed up the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>ſhall raiſe us alſo by his power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 5. Laſtly, this doctrin aſſureth us of our perſeverance in grace begun, Chriſt by his power lays ſuch faſt hold on us: no ſeducer is able to deceive the elect, nor pluck them out of his hands: for the weakneſs of God is ſtronger than men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25. and when we cannot comprehend him ſo faſt as wee would, he comprehends us, and preſerves us by <hi>his power to ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. Neither doth this Doctrin maintain any ſecurity but the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of faith, which is ever attended with the fear of God, and fear to ſinne.</p>
                     <p>The Second thing in the victory of our Saviour is the manner of Satans leaving him: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſaith St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> more plainly, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, which implies a bodily departure and ſenſible, as we have formerly ſhewed his preſence to be.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What kind of departure was this? it ſeems to be a willing and voluntary ſubjection to Chriſt: he bids him depart, and he is gone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Indeed it ſeems obedience, but it is nothing leſs than true obedience: for, 1 He came of his own motion, but went away by Chriſts, who ſpake a powerful word, which he could not, nor durſt reſiſt. 2 He goes when hee can ſtay no longer, his commiſſion for this time was now expired, his liberty was reſtrained, the temptations were ended, God permits him now no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and now he leaves the Son of God: and ſo left he <hi>Job</hi> in the ſame reaſon, when he had vexed him as much as he could obtain leave to doe. 3 Satan could not change his wicked nature, in leaving Chriſt hee leaves not his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt him, only hee leaveth the exerciſe of it for the preſent. 4 He returns again afterward, and ſets upon our Saviour with new aſſaults, which is a plain argument he went now againſt his will.</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>To doe that which God commandeth, and to leave undone that which he forbiddeth, is not always a ſign of true grace.</hi> The Devil is commanded to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40284:130"/> give over tempting of Chriſt, and he giveth over; is commanded to be gone, and he goeth; yet this is no argument of true grace; and that which is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto the Devil, cannot be a ſign of grace in any man, but as there is a forced and feigned, obedience in Satan himſelf, ſo in all his inſtruments, which proceeds not from any true grace, let them flatter themſelves in it never ſo much. <hi>Cain</hi> offers Sacrifice as well as <hi>Abel,</hi> and brings a ſhew of obedience, but his heart being filled with murderous thoughts, was voyd of all grace. <hi>Balaam</hi> was commanded not to curſe the people of God, and hee profeſſed, that if <hi>Balac</hi> would give his <hi>houſe full of ſilver he would not doe it;</hi> as if hee had made great conſcience of Gods Commandement; but it was much againſt his will: for having received an anſwer from God, not to curſe them, he would not be anſwered, but went again and again to know the mind of God, not content to teſt in that anſwer, with which he was not pleaſed. And after that, he giveth <hi>balac wicked counſel,</hi> to ſend his people to <hi>Sittim</hi> to offer to their Idols, where <hi>Iſrael</hi> was likely to fall in love with women, and ſo commit fornication with them: by which he brought the curſe of God amongſt them, whereby numbers of them were deſtroyed. Here was a ſeeming obedience, without any grace in the heart.</p>
                     <p>Exod. 8.19. <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> and the reſt of the Enchanters of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſtood out in reſiſting <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſo long as they could, and then gave over; but not of any conſcience, but becauſe in the plague of the Lice they ſaw <hi>the finger of God,</hi> againſt which they could not prevail. The like was the obedience of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they deſiſted from perſecuting the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.35. becauſe <hi>Gamaliel</hi> a Doctor of the Law perceived, that they did fight againſt God. Adde hereunto the example of <hi>Judas,</hi> who after his ſin of betraying his Lord, made a fair ſhew of repentance, confeſſed his ſin, reſtored the mony, bewayled and juſtified his Maſter; but all this without all grace in his heart; for he went away and hanged himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 A man only by repreſſing and reſtraining grace, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
                        </label> may both doe many things which God hath commanded, and leave undone what God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; as <hi>Haman</hi> refrained himſelf from <hi>Mordecai,</hi> Heſt. 5.10. though his heart was full of wrath, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.5. Many other things might hinder him from the preſent execution of his rage againſt <hi>Mordecai,</hi> as that <hi>Mordecai</hi> was as in a Sanctuary, the Kings gate, that he was the Kings ſervant, that it was better to reſerve him to a ſhameful death, and effect it by a kind of form of Law, than to embrue his own hands in the bloud of the Kings ſervant, and ſo endanger himſelf. But the chief cauſe is Gods reſtraint of wicked mens fury, that they cannot execute what they can determine againſt his Church, though hee uſe ſundry means to reſtrain them. Nay further, a wicked man may be reſtrained from ſome evils, which the child of God may fall into: he affects an outward form and credit, and glory of an outward profeſſion ſometimes, and to attain this end in which he notably deceives himſelf, he cannot enjoy the pleaſures of ſin with greedineſs; not becauſe he conſcionably hateth theſe ſins, but hee is bridled with the credit of his profeſſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Obedience proceeding from true grace is ſo qualified,

For, 1 it is an effect of the love of God, and of goodneſs. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.20. <hi>Chooſe life, by loving the Lord, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his voice, and cleaving unto him:</hi> Joſh. 22.5. <hi>Take heed to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Law, which</hi> Moſes <hi>the ſervant of the Lord commanded you,</hi> that is, <hi>that yee love the Lord your God, and walk in all his waies, and keep his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and cleave unto him.</hi> Love excludes all coaction and conſtraint. Now wicked men reſembling their Father the Devil, cannot love God, nor goodneſſe, but notwithſtanding all their pretences, are haters of God, and enemies of righteouſneſſe; they care not for his favour above life, they love not his preſence, nor to bee with him, nor his Image in his Child, nor
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40284:131"/> his will in his word, nor his houſe, nor his holineſſe to reſemble him, nor his glory, but are more troubled at the loſs of a grain of their honour, than all his.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This obedience is a daughter of faith: for <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> whereas wicked men have nothing above corrupt nature, much leſs ſuch a ſupernatural indowment as faith is, which ſo uniteth unto Chriſt, as it makes him more precious than all the World.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It proceedeth from a man wholly renewed and changed: ſuch good fruit muſt come from a good tree; which is the work of ſound grace onely. 1 The underſtanding is inlightened to diſcern between good and evil, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods Word. 2 The will is ſanctified and made willing. 3 The heart is purified by faith, and made a good treaſury, to ſend out good ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and actions. 4 The conſcience is purged, and being perſwaded of the love of God in Chriſt, it ſeeks to preſerve it ſelf good and pure, and in all his waies out of Conſcience indeavours in the good that God requires, and avoids the evil which hee forbids. 5 The affections are renewed, and are ſweetly perſwaded by Gods Spirit to hate all evil, and cleave to that which is good, to grieve they can do no more glory to God, but are at their beſt very unprofitable. But wicked men are never a whit changed, but are all impure, <hi>even their mindes and conſciences,</hi> and out of the abundance of the heart the tongue ſpeaketh, the hand worketh, neither can a bitter fountain ſend out ſweet waters.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Sound Grace within ſendeth forth an obedience which is cheerful; 1 In the undertaking: love makes labours light, and nothing is hard to a good will. 2 In the manner of doing, it is not forced but lead, ruled by the word, rather than over-ruled by power; it laies by all dialogue, diſpute, murmuring, and deſire of diſpenſation. 3 In the meaſure of doing, it will indeavour in all the Commandements, and all duties: no man ſo wicked, but hee can <hi>do many things,</hi> as <hi>Herod,</hi> but hee cannot yield to all. 4 In continuance and concluſion of that hee doth, it holdeth on in doing things purely for a good end, for Gods glory, and not by fits and ſtarts, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveres to the end, and the crown of the work. In all which a wicked man comes ſhort; for whatſoever is forced or feigned muſt bee heavily entered on, and more heavily ended: beſides, whatſoever is from ſuch an one, is joyned with reigning ſin, which hales and tugs him backward, and toils him out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee bee half way in any good work.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 How often doth the Lord reject the ſacrifice of the wicked, their obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their faſts, their prayers, their temporary, yea, miraculous Faith, their almes and charity, yea, their confeſſing and Preaching of Chriſt, as in the laſt judgement? all which had they been fruits of ſound grace, they had been acceptable. But God looks not ſo much to the matter of the work, as the perſon working, the manner of working, and the end of the action.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Well, as Satan goes away when hee can ſtay no longer, and ſo his obedience is forced, ſo doth ſin from moſt men when they can keep it no longer; and ſo that which ſeemeth obedience in them, it is no better than the Devils obedience in this place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Many refrain many ſins for fear of Hell, and the curſe of God, they dare not hold their ſin any longer, whereas they are as much in love with it as before: as <hi>Moſes</hi> his Parents kept him ſo long as they durſt, before they expoſed him to the waters: ſo dearly love men the children of their own corruption. What thank is it for a Robber or Felon, to leave robbing and ſtealing for fear of hanging? If there were no Law, nor Magiſtrate, hee would to his own calling again, becauſe hee is no changeling. So what thank is it for a man to avoid ſin, becauſe of damnation? here is no fear of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40284:131"/> God, but fear of evil; no love of God, but ſelf-love. And yet this is the reſtraint of moſt men, whom Conſcience no whit bridleth. Why do men abſtain from open wronging of men, by Robbing, Stealing, Murthering? they will ſay for Conſcience. But then the ſame Conſcience would keep them from all ſecret deceit, lying, and couſenage: and then the ſame conſcience would keep them from all other ſins alſo, as ſwearing, drinking, dicing, carding, gaming, pride, wantonneſs, and the reſt. A good conſcience in one thing, is a good conſcience in all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The like is the obedience of many ſinners, that are ſtill in league with their ſins. Many filthy unclean whoremongers and harlots have left their ſin, but it is becauſe it hath leſt them, they have broken their ſtrength, and either age or diſeaſes in their bodies hinder them; oh now they will pretend Conſcience. But they can as filthily ſpeak, and as merrily remember their mad pranks, as ever they acted them; they want onely a body, no minde, will, or affection, to commit over the ſame things again. Many Prodigals have left their ſin, becauſe their wealth hath left them, and poverty feeds upon them. Many quarrellers and ſwaggerers have left off ſuch furious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: why? perhaps they have gotten ſome maim, or miſchief, or perhaps they fear whether they can do ſo again ſafely, or no: and this is all the conſcience that hath calmed and quieted them: but what obedience is this? Is that an obedience to God, for a Dicer or Gameſter to forbear play (or rather, as it is, his theeving) when he wants mony to ſtake?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 In Gods ſervice, what makes men come to Church, to hear, and Pray? Every man ſaith, Conſcience. Yea, but good Conſcience works powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Will: what then means the unwillingneſſe of men, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe, who are ſo far from apprehending their week-occaſions, as if they ask their own hearts, they muſt tell them, that on the Sabbaths of God, were it not for fear of law, and ſhame of men (both which are often forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) they would not come at all. Here is obedience, much like the Devils, becauſe they are of the Devils teaching. The like of many ſervants and Childrens obedience, whoſe comming to Church to hear their duty, is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced by the compulſion of Maſters and Parents; and hath as little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it as the Devils obedience.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The like is to bee ſaid of late Repentance at the time of death: when the ſinner hath held his ſin ſo long as hee can, then hee would bee rid of it. Indeed his ſin leaves him, but not the curſe of it: but hee is ſo far from lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, as were hee to live over his daies again, hee would put as much life into his ſin as ever before. Late repentance is ſeldome true, ever ſuſpicious. Why do many rich men never do good while they live, but live as unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and hurtful, as ſwine till they come to the knife; but then when death is binding them, they will give ſomewhat to good uſes, to the Poor, for a Sermon, &amp;c. Why? what moves them? Conſcience, they ſay. But it is an accuſing Conſcience, crying out, againſt their oppreſſion, uſury, wrong, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and deceit; and now this wicked Conſcience would ſtop its own mouth, by offering to God ſome trifle of that hee hath robbed. For were it a good conſcience, why doth hee not leave ſome part of his wealth for God, before it wholly leave him? Were it a free-will-offering, why comes it ſo late? why doth hee not good, <hi>while hee hath time? Gal.</hi> 6.10. Surely, God likes a living Chriſtian: for any man will bee a Chriſtian dying. Neither is it thank-worthy to give that which a man cannot keep. And commonly ſuch gifts do more good to others than the giver himſelf. Which is not ſpoken to hinder men from doing good at their deaths, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to do good before that time. And yet better late, than never.</p>
                     <p>Let us examine all our obedience by this ground, and bee ſure that it differ from the obedience of Devils and wicked men. And that by theſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40284:132"/> rules: 1 <hi>God loves truth in the inward parts,</hi> and refuſeth all that obedience which follows not ſanctification of the Spirit: duties without muſt flow from graces within. Examine now thy inward change: wee are his new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, created to good works: joyn that in thy actions which the Devil divorced, the inner man with the outward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſubjection of the ſoul with the obedience of the body.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Examine thy love in thy obedience, that becauſe the love of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains thee, thou doeſt what hee commands, and whether thou preferreſt the Commandement of God, which is ever-joyned with his glory, above all the World, and thy obedience above thy profit, credit, caſe, pleaſure, mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or diſ-favour, whether thou canſt obey God againſt all theſe. This was <hi>Abrahams</hi> love to God in ſo difficult a Commandement, as the killing of his Son. But Satan here went away, not for love of God, but for fear, and being forced.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Examine thy manner of obeying, whether it bee a willing and ready obedience. <hi>If I do it willingly</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I have a reward:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Yee have obeyed from the heart,</hi> or <hi>heartily.</hi> And ſuch obedience, 1 Repineth not as giving God any thing too much, though the deareſt things of all. 2 Deviſeth no excuſes, as <hi>Saul</hi> when hee did but half the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, pretended ſacrifice, and the peoples inſtance. 3 Seeketh no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies: <hi>I made haſte, and delayed not to keep thy righteous judgements,</hi> Pſal. 1 19.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Doeſt thou obey in all the Commandements? 1 The commandement of faith in the Goſpel, as well as the actual obedience of the Law? for one is as acceptable as the other. 2 Obeyeſt thou the Commandement as well of doing good, as of abſtaining from evil? for, the Devil here abſtains from this evil of tempting Chriſt, but can never do any good: hee joines not theſe Commandements in his practice, as Gods Spirit doth in his precept, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. 3 Makeſt thou conſcience of the leaſt commandement as well as of the greateſt? for, all of them have a ſtamp of God upon them: makeſt thou conſcience of ſmall oaths, vain words, roving thoughts? 4 Doeſt thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey conſtantly? for, <hi>love is ſtrong as death, and much water cannot quench it.</hi> But alaſs! much obedience is like that of <hi>Davids</hi> falſe friends, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.44, 45. <hi>ſtrangers ſhall bee in ſubjection to me, but they ſhall ſhrink away.</hi>

                     <p n="3">III. The THIRD point followeth to bee conſidered, namely, how long Satan left our Lord; not for ever after, but for a while: and ſurely he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away but a little while. For if wee look into the holy ſtory, wee ſhall ſee the whole life of Chriſt almoſt to bee a continual temptation, and how Satan from time to time, partly by himſelf, and partly by his Miniſters, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled him. This we ſhall ſee how ſundry waies Satan moleſted him and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, 1 in his miniſtery, 2 his life, 3 his death.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In his miniſtery, hee was tempted both in his Doctrin and Miracles. For his Doctrin: the Scribes and Phariſees often ſought to catch advantages againſt him, as in the caſe of the Bill of divorce, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.1. and of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken in adultery, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. which by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law ſhould bee ſtoned; but <hi>Maſter what ſayeſt thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> The <hi>Sadduces</hi> alſo tempted him in the caſe of the woman that had ſeven Husbands, whoſe ſhee ſhould bee in the reſurrection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.23. And the Lawyer concerning the great Commandement of the Law, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. As for his Miracles the ſeal of that Doctrin, they tell him to his face <hi>that he cast out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1.2.24.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In his life and civil Obedience. The Phariſees take Counſel together how they might entangle him in his talk about paying tribute to <hi>Caeſar, Matth.</hi> 22.15. And when hee ate meat in <hi>Matthews</hi> houſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.11. they asked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why hee did eat meat with Publicans and ſinners, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40284:132"/> hee was one of them. <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee ſeeing <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing Jeſus his feet with pretious ointment, and waſhing them with tears, and wiping them with her hairs, ſaid, <hi>Surely if this man were a Prophet, hee would know that this woman is a ſinner, and not let her meddle with him.</hi> How often did they murmure at him, and lye in wait for him, and take up ſtones to ſtone him, and rail upon him, with moſt deſpightful words, calling him <hi>Beelzebub, a Samaritan, a glutton, a looſe companion, running up and down with noted ſinners?</hi> in all which Satan was the chief agent.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 But above all other temptations thoſe were moſt fierce and furious, with which hee was afflicted, torn, and tormented about the time of his paſſion, and on the Croſs. For then, as himſelf witneſſeth, the <hi>Prince of the World came upon him with all his train, Joh.</hi> 14.30. hee came in himſelf, and whole Legions of wicked Angels with him, as the Apoſtle plainly implyeth, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Hee ſpoiled Principalities, and Powers, and triumphed over them on the Croſs.</hi> Now or never Satan muſt win the field, this is the laſt act, Chriſt was never ſo beſet with miſery, Satan never had him at ſuch an advantage before; now Gods whole wrath is upon him, and now the Devil and his Angels ſet upon him ſo ſore, that in his Agony in the Garden hee ſweats drops of water and blood, and on the Croſs hee cries out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken mee?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe were more ſecret temptations of Satan and his inſtruments: but let us ſee with what helliſh darts they pierced him openly upon the Croſs, not to ſpeak of thoſe which hee endured all the time hee was in examination, condemnation, and leading to execution. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 They hang him between two theeves, as an arch-rebel, and of all ſinners the greateſt, and dart againſt him the ſame temptation with that in all this Hiſtory, that hee was not the Son of God, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, come down from the croſs:</hi> certainly God would not let his Son hang there, but thou art a deluder, an arch-ſeducer of the people.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They tempted him with fear of death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.42. <hi>hee ſaved others, himſelf hee cannot ſave;</hi> this is a wiſe Saviour indeed, hee cannot eſcape death in whoſe hands hee is ſure enough, and even overcome already of death, and yet hee will bee a Saviour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 They tempted him with utter rejection from God, as the moſt damned reprobate that ever was, <hi>Hee truſted in God, now let him deliver him if he will have him:</hi> but hee can neither deliver himſelf, nor God will have none of him, hee abhors him, and will caſt him preſently to Hell. Theſe and a number of the like was our Saviour moleſted and tempted withall, ſecretly and openly, even then when the wrath of his Father ſeiſed upon him. So as truely the Evangeliſt might ſay, that Satan left him but <hi>for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>Chriſtian life is but an entercourſe of quiet and trouble:</hi> ſometime Satan leaves Chriſt, but hee comes again and renews his temptation: ſo it is with the members, who have much war, but ſome peace, many troubles, but ſome breathing-time. This truth wee will a while diſcover both in the ſtate of the whole Church of God from time to time, as alſo in ſome particular members thereof.</p>
                     <p>What a night ſeemed to oppreſs the Church in the cradle, when wicked <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> ſo as all religion and true worſhip ſeemed to bee deſtroyed in all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, having onely <hi>Cain</hi> left? But ſhortly after God gave <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>Seth,</hi> in whom the Church was reſtored and preſerved, and pure religion propagated. In <hi>Henochs</hi> time how was the worſhip of God prophaned, when <hi>the Sons of God married the daughters of men,</hi> which was the cauſe of the flood? but afterward it was reſtored by <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Sem,</hi> and by him continued to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now the Church, as it was in the Ark, ſo was
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40284:133"/> it like the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> againſt which the waters had a time to increaſe and a time alſo of decreaſing.</p>
                     <p>What a night of trouble was the Church in, all the while it was in <hi>Aegypt</hi> a ſtranger for four hundred years, eſpecially when they were oppreſſed with burdens, and had their infants drowned in the river? but a change came, God ſent and ſaved a <hi>Moſes,</hi> by whom hee will deliver his people, but ſo as they muſt be acquainted with this continual enterchange in their eſtate: they muſt be no ſooner delivered out of <hi>Aegyps,</hi> but be chaſed into the bottom of the Sea, but there God makes them a way: and no ſooner out of the Sea, but into the Wilderneſs, and from thence the good Land takes them: and in that good Land they never reſted in one eſtate, but ſometimes had the better of their enemies, and ſometime for ſin their enemies had the better of them, as all the Hiſtory of the <hi>Judges</hi> witneſſeth.</p>
                     <p>In the time of the Kings, how was the Church troubled and waſted, in the time of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> when all Gods Prophets were ſlain, and true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was quite troden down? But what a ſudden change was there? even when things were at the worſt, did the Lord bring a ſtrange alteration by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah,</hi> who ſlew all the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> and reſtored true religion. How great miſery ſuffered the Church in the time of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and <hi>Ammon?</hi> but how happily was it changed by the piety of good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> in whom God made his people more happy than formerly miſerable? But who would have thought but that the Church had been utterly waſted in the ſeventy years captivity, wherein it ſate in the ſhadow of death? Yet it was happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But when his godly Decrees concerning the building of the Temple were hindered by <hi>Cambyſes</hi> his Son, God ſtirred up <hi>Darius</hi> who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Church, and commanded the continuance and perfection of the work; but not without many viciſſitudes of ſtormes and calmes, even after their return, as appeareth in the books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What a raging ſtorm was that, wherein our Lord and Head of the Church was put to death? now the whole Church lay bleeding and dead with him. But what a change was there the third day by his glorious reſurrection? In the Apoſtles daies, how was the Church waſted when <hi>Saul</hi> had letters from the High Prieſts to carry bound to <hi>Jeruſalem, whoſoever called on the Lord?</hi> but when hee that breathed out nothing but ſlaughter and threatning, was once converted, then the <hi>Church had for a whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this laſted not long, but his ſecond Son <hi>Conſtantius</hi> (far ſhort of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers piety) with all his ſtrength ſet up and maintained that <hi>Arrian hereſy,</hi> which his good Father had condemned in the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council: by which as bloody perſecution ſprung up in the Church as ever was before, which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt eighty years, until <hi>Conſtance</hi> the youngeſt Son of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> for up again the <hi>Nicen</hi> faith in the Weſtern part of the World, as <hi>Italy, Greece, Africk, Illiricum,</hi> and baniſhed the former poyſon.

And as pitchy and palpable darkneſs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and Popery occupied the Weſtern part of the World. But what a light did the Lord raiſe up in the midſt of Popery, his zealous ſervant <hi>Luther,</hi>

But this Sun-ſhine laſted not long, but in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies the truth was again caſt into the fire, and the bodies of Gods Saints pitileſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed.

This hath been the changeable eſtate of the Church from the beginning; and, <hi>cadem eſt ratio totius ac partium,</hi> the ſame truth diſcovers it ſelf in the particular members.</p>
                     <p>As for example. <hi>Abraham</hi> now a poor man in <hi>Egypt,</hi> preſently enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made heir of the Land of Promiſe; now rejoycing in his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and a while after ſtretching out his hand to kill his only Son; who alſo herein was a notable type of the Church, now bound, and preſently looſed, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up after a ſort from the dead. <hi>Jacob</hi> was now afraid of <hi>Eſau,</hi> when he came in warlike manner to meet him, with four hundred men at his heels; but in a little ſeaſon God lets him ſee a ſuddain change, who had inclined his Brothers heart to do him no harm, againſt his often former purpoſes to ſlay him. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is now hated of his brethren, after a ſeaſon honoured of them: now ſold as a ſlave to the <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> afterward made a governour of <hi>Potiphar</hi> a Princes houſe: now accuſed by his Miſtreſſe, and caſt into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but after fetched out by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and made ruler of all his Princes, and the whole land of <hi>Egypt.

And <hi>Jobs</hi> meſſengers of evil tydings ſtill overtook one another. And to ſpare further examples, our own experience can teach us, that for the moſt part, wee have not rid our ſelves out of one temptation, but another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth; ſuch are our changes in this preſent eſtate. And why?</p>

This deadly malice in his nature our Saviour noteth, in Matth. 12.44. <hi>The unclean ſpirit when hee is caſt out, ſeeks to re-enter, and return again, and where hee findes a fit houſe, hee brings in ſeven Devils worſe than himſelf.</hi> Hee is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to watch our miſchief, and if hee cannot prevail at one time, hee will aſſay another.</p>

Then let us not dream of ſo ſtable a peace in our Church and Land, as mens ſecurity every where hath ſeemed to lay hold of, looking at the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſition of our gracious King, at his hopeful Succeſſor, at our union among our ſelves, at our league with all other Nations, at the continuance and undiſturbed eſtate and liberty of the Goſpel for theſe ſixty years. For, 1. God ſeeth not good to give any Church on earth an unchangeable eſtate: that is the Churches expectation in Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Our peace hath brought in a general ſecurity, prophaneneſs, intolerable pride of all faſhions and colours, beſide modeſt and white, a deluge of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs daily drowning the brains and ſouls of thouſands, a wearineſs of <hi>this Mannah,</hi> a dangerous Apoſtaſie from the firſt beginnings of the Goſpel, and a falling back of many great ones into the profeſſed Idolatry of Antichriſt, and in the moſt a contempt of religion, yea and of a formal <hi>profeſſion that denies the power and life of godlineſs.</hi> Adde to theſe execrable ſwearing unpuniſhed, ſoul adulteries unrevenged, or ſlightly puniſhed, the Sabbaths of God hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly and generally violated and prophaned, by games and practices unlawful upon any day.

                     <p n="3">3 Conſider how God dealt with his own people: they had as long peace, under <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> as wiſe and excellent a King as ever was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eminent type of Chriſt; yet we ſee what long eaſe and peace brought him to, which was the overthrow of his Kingdom, and the renting of ten parts of twelve from him to his ſervant: he was a King of peace, as his name imported, had poſterity, had made a league with all neighbour-nations; yet God being provoked, brings a woeful change on him, and his Land. So may it be to us.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Conſider how God hath threatned us of late years to bring in woful chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to remove the Goſpel, and give away our Kingdom, Liberties, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and lives to ſtrangers. Remember that admirable year of eighty eight, and that no leſs admirable threatning and deliverance in one thouſand ſix hundred and five; forget not the raging and devouring plague, in which there was no peace or ſafety to him that went in and out. Remember the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fire in many great places of the Land, burning up whole Towns and Villages: the general diſeaſes and diſtempers in mens bodies, which have been as univerſal as our provocation hath been: the change of our ſeaſons, the breaking out of waters drowning the earth, the infection of the air, many barbarous Conſpiracies againſt the life of ſo innocent and merciful a King, and the hot contentions of many brethren in our own Church. All which are remarkable ſigns of Gods diſpleaſure, if not fore-runners of a lamentable change. But he that conſidereth how all theſe things are forgotten and worn away unprofitably, without all wholſome uſe or reformation, cannot but think that the Lord (if timely repentance hinder not) will take ſome other courſe, and ſo ſpeak as hee will be heard: for the truth never fayls, which you have heard at large; one Judgement is ever a fore runner of another, unleſs repentance cuts them off. O that God would put it in the hearts of high and low, to ſeek the continuance of our happy peace, in our ſeaſonable ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God by repentance, and not ſeeking ſtill to provoke him by wilful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency.</p>

                     <p>Many ſay, never were any ſo foulely tempted, not ſo often as they: their fleſh trembles, and their hair ſtands an end, to think what foul temptations Satan ſuggeſteth with great inſtance: But, can there bee a fouler temptation than to worſhip the Devil himſelf? yet the Son of God was tempted to it. Therefore reſiſt as he did, and the ſin is not thine, but Satans, who ſhall bee damned, but thou ſhalt be ſaved in the day of the Lord.

Let us therefore fix our eyes upon thoſe eternal good things, and that eternal peace, and that Kingdom which cannot bee ſhaken: For <hi>the things which are ſeen, are temporal, but the things not ſeen are eternal.</hi> And then, whatſoever I loſe, it is but a moveable, my inheritance is ſale and ſure.</p>

But when a <hi>Legion</hi> of wicked Angels are ſaid to bee in one man, it is neceſſary that ſpirits defined to bee in one place cannot at the ſame time bee without that place, till they bee moved thence into another.

                     <p n="1">I. For our comprehenſion:
<note place="margin">Iſa. 6.2.</note> the Angels <hi>with two wings cover their face and feet:</hi> this ſignifieth that their nature is hid and removed from the knowledge of man. And <hi>with twain their bodies are covered,</hi> Ezek. 1.11. to ſignifie the ſame. And <hi>their hands are under their wings,</hi> by which is meant, that their powerful and ſecret operation alſo cannot bee diſcerned with bodily eyes. Therefore hath the Scripture expreſſed their nature under diverſe ſhapes, and aſcribed unto them many parts both of men and other creatures, in which we may ſee and underſtand their work and office: as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. Angels are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by four beaſts; not becauſe they are no more in number (for, <hi>thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſit at his right hand</hi>) but becauſe they doe the Commandements of God in all the four quarters of the world. Theſe beaſts have four ſeveral faces: 1 <hi>The face of a man,</hi> to note, that all of them are reaſonable and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding creatures, as man is. 2 <hi>The face of a Lion,</hi> to ſignifie, that every Angel is ſtrong, and powerful, and couragious, as the Lion among the beaſts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. <hi>Praiſe the Lord yee Angels ſtrong in power.</hi> One of them is ſtronger than a number of men, yea than a number of Devils. 3 <hi>The face of an Oxe,</hi> to note their patience, aſſiduity, and unweariableneſs in their ſervice and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, as the Oxe is a beaſt moſt patient, and conſtant, and profitable in his pains. 4 <hi>The face of an Eagle,</hi> to note their ſwiftneſs and alacrity, ſeeing a faire off many hidden things, as the Eagle; flying ſtrongly and ſwiftly, that is, unreſiſtably as the Eagle; holding out, not fainting, but renewing their ſtrength as the Eagle.</p>
                     <p>By the ſame Prophet they are deſcribed, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.22. by the ſhape of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubs; which were the faces of little fair boys with wings, noting unto us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that reſemblance their nature, to be voyd of deceit as a child, ſimple, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, not proud, or arrogant, not envious or malicious. Having <hi>wings,</hi> to note their readineſs and expedition in their miniſtery: and theſe wings in their four ſides, to ſhew that their miniſtery extended to all the four ſides of the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. By way of diſpenſation they have often aſſumed bodies that were true, immediately created of God, not imaginary or phantaſtical, as <hi>Marcion</hi> thought, whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> refuted, neither generated nor born as mans body is, nor hypoſtatically united to the Angels as conſtitutive parts, as our body is a conſtituting part of us; but taken upon them for the time of ſome ſpecial ſervice, and layd down again, even as we doe our apparrel, to the end they might familiarly conferre and converſe with men, till that ſpecial ſervice were performed.</p>
                     <p>Thus did they viſibly appear unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot:</hi> thus was the Angel of God ſeen like a fourth man in the Furnace, which the three Children were caſt into: and in this humane ſhape, I doubt not but they came and appeared to the Son of God in this place. My reaſons are theſe: 1 If the Angels came of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in bodily ſhape to the ſervants and adopted children of God, why ſhould they not much more to the natural Son of God, being cloathed with the ſame fleſh? 2 We have formerly proved, that the Devil came in aſſumed bodily ſhape, the more to moleſt and terrifie the Son of God, and therefore the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels came to him alſo in bodily ſhape, the more to comfort him. 3 The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate of Chriſt required it, who was man, and ſubject to many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore the Angels came corporally to comfort him. 4 The phraſe of the text implies a more ſenſible and peculiar manifeſtation of them than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: as in his agony an Angel appeared to him, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>In this coming of the Angels, note an happy change in the eſtate of our Lord and Saviour: for in ſtead of the Devil his deadly enemy, come the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels his friends and houſhold ſervants: in ſtead of one Devil many Angels;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40284:137"/> for all are his to attend him: in ſtead of ſharp hunger for forty days together, now he hath bodily food and comfort in a moment.</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>God may hide his comforts for a time, but at length they ſhall ſhine out upon his ſervants, as the Sun from under a cloud.</hi> All the time of the temptation Chriſt was without food, without Angels, nay he endured ſharpneſs of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in his body, and of Satanical vexation in his ſoul: now the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts him, not only in removing evil from him, but reſtoring to him his whole former peace, beſides the glory of a moſt victorious conqueſt. And the ſame is his dealing with his ſervants: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. <hi>David</hi> being plunged ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly with a grievous temptation of Atheiſm; not whether there was a God or no, but whether this God were juſt and merciful, ſeeing things fell out ſo croſs to good men, and ſo proſperouſly to the wicked; at laſt breaks out into a ſetled reſolution, <hi>Yet God is good to Iſrael.</hi> He was in the temptation as a man caſt into the Sea, ſouzed in one billow after another, at length hee deſcries a ſhore, and with extream toyl and peril he gets thither, and crawls up, and ſaith, Yet I have eſcaped drowning. Or as a man in a pitcht field, that in the thick of his enemies had eſcaped many blows and deadly thruſts, being ſet beyond the danger ſaith, Yet I am alive. So the Lord, though in temptation he ſeem to ſtand farre off, yet at laſt appears with ſtrength and comfort. The ſame <hi>David</hi> being in great diſtreſs a long time, hunted as a Partrich by <hi>Saul,</hi> but ſtrangely delivered from him and <hi>Achiſh,</hi> concludes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19. <hi>That how great ſoever the troubles of the righteous be, yet the Lord will at length deliver them out of all.</hi> To this purpoſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>that though the just man fall ſeven times a day,</hi> namely, into affliction, <hi>yet hee riſeth again.</hi>

                        <hi>Abraham</hi> in his great trial ſaw nothing but ſorrow and vexation for the loſs of his <hi>Iſaac:</hi> yet in the third day, when the caſe ſeemed deſperate, <hi>God was ſeen in the mountain;</hi> as if he had not ſeen God till he came into the mountain. Whence his poſterity uſed it as a proverbial ſpeech, <hi>In the mount God will bee ſeen:</hi> at the fartheſt he will be ſeen there, if not before. <hi>Job</hi> aſſured himſelf, that after darkneſs <hi>he ſhould ſee light;</hi> and according to his faith, wee ſee howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Satan ſet upon him, with all his might, to blaſpheme God, and his friends would needs prove him an Hypocrite; and which was worſt of all, God not only ſtood a farre off from him, but came upon him and againſt him, as one that ſtrove <hi>againſt the Almighty, and one that reproved his Maker,</hi> chap. 39. verſ. 35. Yet at length he ſteps out for him, acquits him, and rebukes his friends, and accepts his ſervant, and turneth his captivity, and gives him twice as much as before he had, <hi>chap.</hi> 42.</p>

Therefore it is that ſometimes he fore-tells his children of evils to come, that they ſhould not come ſuddenly on them, neither diſtruſt his care in them, nor be ignorant of a good iſſue out of them.

For, 1 The godly mans preſent eſtate is the beſt for him, bee it what it can be: the Furnace is the fitteſt place for gold. 2 His trial ſhall bee turned to good, becauſe God hath the diſpoſing, tempering, and moderating of it. 3 His trial ſhall be but light and momentany, not in reſpect of the preſent ſenſe, but becauſe the time of temptation ſhall be ſwallowed up by the time of victory. 4 The end of it ſhall be happy: and all is well that ends well:

Let this ſerve as a ground of comfort and encouragement to us, that when with <hi>Iſrael</hi> we ſtand as it were on the Sea-brink, beſet with dangers, then we may be ſtill, and expect the ſalvation of the Lord. For as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh, (<hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>The viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the laſt it ſhall ſpeak, and not lye: if it tarry, wais; for it ſhall ſurely come, and ſhall not ſtay.</hi> Let us not make haſte, nor limit the Lord in preſcribing him a time and means, but leave all that to his wiſdome, lean upon his arm, relye upon his word, he hath a mind to doe us good, and that when it ſhall be moſt for his glory and our ſalvation.

Even ſo, when this Land was like that fiery Furnace, made ſeven times hotter than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to conſume the bodies of Gods Saints, in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, in the midſt of thoſe flames God ſent that happy <hi>Queen</hi> (now a bleſſed Saint) to quench thoſe fires, and deliver our whole Church from that tyrannical and Papal oppreſſion.

                     <p>We have ſpoken of the Angels coming: Now the laſt thing conſiderable in this Hiſtory, is their miniſtery unto Chriſt; wherein are two things: 1 How they miniſter to him: 2 Why they miniſter.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. 1 They miniſtred in adoring the Son of God, the only conquerour of the Devil, and honouring him as the victorious deſtroyer of the Prince, and Commander of all helliſh powers: For the Angels rejoyced in Chriſts victory, in the Devils overthrow, and the ſalvation of the Church of God. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their nature carries them wholly to the glory of God, in all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motions, and the good of the Church; as at the birth of Chriſt they ſung, <hi>Glory to God on high, on earth peace, and good will to men.</hi> And there is no doubt but now upon this victory, they did much more honour him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his glorious triumph.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:40284:138"/>2 They miniſtred to him in comforting him, being in his ſoul extreamly afflicted and moleſted with Satans temptations: for how could the Son of God but utterly abhorr, and with fiery zeal deteſt ſuch blaſphemous temptations, as that hee ſhould not only diſtruſt his Fathers providence, but even fall down and worſhip the Devil himſelf, with which temptations a ſinful man yet in his corrupt nature, would be exceedingly diſtracted and diſturbed? It is no doubt therefore, but as in his Agony before his Paſſion, the Angels came to comfort him, ſo likewiſe in this conflict and perturbation, ſo ſoon as they might, they came in to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 They miniſtred to him in releeving his body, which was now broken with hunger, and watchings, having already faſted forty days and forty nights; and brought him food to allay his hunger, ſpreading as it were a table for him in the wilderneſs. For, if they neglected not the ſervant of God <hi>Elias</hi> in the wilderneſs, being ready to ſtarve for food, but provided him a meal, in ſtrength whereof he went forty days and forty nights, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.5. much leſs would they neglect the Son of God, who was now in the ſame neceſſity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 They miniſtred to him, ſtanding about him, and giving attendance, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were at his table, and ready to be employed in any further ſervice hee had to command them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. <hi>Yee Angels ready to execute his will.</hi> Whence in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.11. the Angels are deſcribed with wings ſtretched upward, noting their propenſity and readineſs to the Commandements of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Why the Angels do thus miniſter to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not for any neceſſity of his (for 1 He was able to have ſuſtained himſelf, and held out for ever againſt the Devil: 2 He was able to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the Devil: 3 He was able to have created food in the wilderneſs without them, which they could not do: for, although they could fetch food elſewhere provided, yet could they not create any,) but, 1 It was their duty to attend him as their Lord, called <hi>the Lord of the holy Angels.</hi> 2 Chriſt would now uſe their miniſtery, and did not help himſelf by Miracle, as he might, if he had pleaſed. But we read not that he uſed his power for himſelf or his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Himſelf being hungry and weary at <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well, he created not food, but ſent his Diſciples into the City to buy bread: And when his Diſciples were faint and hungry, they were fain to pluck ears of Corn, and eat it: But yet he uſed not his miraculous power. For Miracles were wrought for the edification of others, and commonly done in the preſence of many, whoſe faith was to be ſtrengthned, as the Diſciples was in part already. 3 This was ſo for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and conſolation, that we alſo in our wants, ſtanding in the Lords bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, may expect the preſence and comfort of the Angels.</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>The priviledge of Chriſt, whereby hee is exalted above all creatures, hence appeareth, in that the Angels miniſter unto him.</hi> Heb. 1.6. the Apoſtle proves Chriſts divinity, and eminency above all things, out of that teſtimony of the Pſalm, <hi>And let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> For, he muſt needs be greater than all, who muſt bee honoured of all. <hi>Job.</hi> 1.51. Chriſt himſelf proves himſelf the Son of God, becauſe, notwithſtanding he is <hi>the Son of man,</hi> which plainly notes him to be, 1 A true man, and 2 A weak man: yet they ſhould ſee the Heavens opened, and <hi>the Angels aſcending and deſcending upon him,</hi> as was figured in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. For Chriſt is the Ladder, and only way by which we aſcend into Heaven. <hi>It reached from earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> ſignifying his two Natures, God of his Father in Heaven, man of <hi>Jacobs</hi> loyns in earth. Angels aſcending and deſcending, are the <hi>miniſtring ſpirits</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him: for in that phraſe is meant their ſending out, their emiſſion, and commiſſion to their office, <hi>deſcending</hi> to their work, and <hi>aſcending</hi> to give account of it. Now according to this Prophecie of Chriſt, two of his Diſciples ſaw the <hi>heavens open upon him in his transfiguration,</hi> Matth. 17.1, 2. In his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, thoſe keepers of the Sepulcher ſaw the Angel of the Lord that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40284:139"/> from heaven,</hi> and had rolled away the ſtone from the door, and ſate upon it, ſo as they were afraid, and as dead men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.4. The women alſo ſaw the Angel and talked with him, that had attended him in his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. And in his Aſcenſion all his Diſciples ſaw the Heavens ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto him, and two Angels ſtanding by them, who attended him, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.</p>

They are in all things ruled and moved by his Spirit? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Whither the Spirit led them, they went:</hi> Let us alſo give up our ſelves to the leading of his Spirit, not running of our own heads in any buſineſs, unſent, without our warrant. They rejoyce in all good things, and in Chriſts victory, the benefit of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to us more than to them, and that men by the ſame are ſet out of the Devils power: And why do not we more rejoyce in this victory of Chriſt? why do we rejoyce in evil, which is the Devils ſin, in ſinful courſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? Why do we hate and ſcorn thoſe, who moſt partake in this victory? How unlike is this to the Angels?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. If the Angels be ſervants unto Chriſt, then we ſee herein both his love to us, and our own honour, who hath vouchſafed us his own ſpecial ſervants to attend us: For he hath not only charged them with the ſafety of <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Lot, Elias, Daniel,</hi> and other extraordinary holy men, but their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is general: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. they ſhall keep <hi>thee</hi> in all thy ways, that is, not only Chriſt himſelf, but every member of Chriſt: for <hi>this honour have all the Saints.</hi> And what a comfort is it, that we ſo weak Creatures, and ſo beſet with ſpiritual and inviſible enemies, have appointed to us by the Lord ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpiritual, inviſible, and more powerful ayders, and aſſiſters? What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is it, that no temporal enemy can ſo ſoon wrong us in our perſons, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, or names, but the Angels of God are ready to turn it off, and keep off the peril, and then return to God to complain of the wrong-doers? What a care ſhould we have not to forfeit our priviledge, to keep us <hi>in our ways,</hi> and walk warily <hi>becauſe of the Angels,</hi> not grieving them by ſin, nor driving them from about us, whoſe protection under Gods is more ſafe than if we lay under ſhield and ſpear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.4. with 11. And if our Lord himſelf received com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from them, how great may be our comfort from them?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Hence we are to aſcribe the glory of Power, Majeſty, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unto our Lord Jeſus, who if he be able to command all the Angels in Heaven, much more all the Devils in Hell, who are farre weaker than they: <hi>All power is his in heaven and earth.</hi> And now we are no longer to eſteem of him according to his baſe eſtate, in the Wilderneſs, in the World, but according to his ſurpaſſing power manifeſted through all this Hiſtory in vanquiſhing the Devil, and in receiving the Divine honour from the moſt glorious Angels. To this great <hi>Michael,</hi> who even without his Angels hath in pitcht battel over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the great red Dragon and all his Angels, be aſcribed all power, might, victory, and triumph, of all men, Saints, and Angels, in earth, and in the higheſt Heavens, for all eternity. Amen. Amen.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et it ſtand with your pleaſures, whom one profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion towards God, and execution of Juſtice towards man, whom one neer Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and one neer affection combine, to bee conjoyned alſo in this Dedication: wherein, as my deſire is to manifeſt my dutiful reſpect of you both, ſo alſo to entreat your favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and acceptance of this my preſumption: whereof I want not juſt reaſons, whether I look upon you joyntly, or ſeverally. Your joynt government under which we the Inhabitants of this Town of <hi>Watford</hi> enjoy our publick peace, bindeth all of us, wherein wee may, to teſtifie our thankfulneſs for ſo great and publick a good. God might govern the World (if he pleaſed) by himſelf immediately, yet he committeth it to Magiſtrates and Rulers, both <hi>ſupream</hi> and <hi>dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates;</hi> whom he honoureth with an high ſtyle, calling them <hi>Aſsiſtants to him that ruleth the whole earth,</hi> Zach. 4.14. yea the <hi>ſhields of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 47.9. to bear off wrongs and evils from men. The <hi>boughes</hi> of this <hi>fair tree</hi> of Magiſtracy (as in that ſacred embleme) are <hi>ſhelter for all,</hi> and the <hi>fruit meat for all,</hi> Dan. 4.7.17. And the weilding of ſo ſtately an Ordinance, is not to be committed, but to fit and qualified perſons, as they are deſcribed by <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> by four moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy properties, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> they muſt be <hi>men of courage,</hi> ſtout to undergoe all the parts
<pb facs="tcp:40284:146"/> of their calling. How fit a vertue this is for a Magiſtrate, will appear, if we conſider, 1 The good and <hi>godly</hi> in the hand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. who are to be incouraged and <hi>praiſed</hi> in well-doing by their Rulers: which will never be, if a man be afraid to be ſeen, or be timorous, as <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> was, who would fain be with Chriſt, but caſt himſelf into the night, as though that had been a work of darkneſs. <hi>Moſes</hi> for his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was called <hi>Pharaohs God,</hi> he told <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to his face, hee would not leave an hoof behind him, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf ſtood in awe of him. 2 The <hi>wicked,</hi> who are ſtout in their wickedneſs; and ſin is with them as <hi>bold as an Harlot,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh. Now the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, with <hi>Job,</hi> muſt beſtirre himſelf, and cloath himſelf with zeal and courage, that the <hi>young men may hide themſelves,</hi> and the <hi>old riſe up at his preſence,</hi> Job 29.8. whereas an irreligious mildneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſſe, ſtrengthneth the hands of the ungodly. 3 The <hi>wicked one,</hi> even Satan himſelf, who emboldneth offenders againſt the chiefeſt Ordinances of God, I mean <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> to bring them into contempt, and ſo bring in all confuſion into the earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> they muſt be men <hi>fearing God,</hi> and they are ſpecially cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>upon to kiſſe the Son of God,</hi> Pſal 2. For, 1 Gods fear is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wiſdome, and who ſhould be wiſe, if not Magiſtrates, to judge and diſcern of the moſt difficult caſes amongſt men? 2 If hee fear not God, he will fear the face of man, and ſo accept of perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.17. 3 He muſt herein aſſiſt the Lord himſelf in planting the fear of God in all his government. <hi>Cyrus muſt perform</hi> not his own, but <hi>all the Lords deſire: hee muſt ſay to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>thou ſhalt bee built,</hi> and to <hi>the Temple, thy foundations ſhall be ſurely laid,</hi> Iſa. 44.28. Every Chriſtian Magiſtrate muſt be a <hi>Nurſing Father to the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and here begin his government, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> with <hi>celebrating the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> Exod. 12. <hi>Joſhua,</hi> with renewing <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> Joſhua 5.7. <hi>Gideon,</hi> with deſtroying <hi>Baal,</hi> Judg. 6. <hi>David,</hi> with eſtabliſhing the Ark; <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> with building Gods houſe, <hi>Aſa,</hi> with renewing the Lords Altar. And whereas many inferiour Magiſtrates look on, whilſt this care ſlippeth into other mens hands; yet muſt they all know, that they are Gods Vicegerents, and the <hi>judgement is Gods,</hi> that is, from God, and for God: and therefore they muſt not only cut off Thefts, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Adulteries, and ſuch barbarous outrages, and ryots againſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace and humane ſociety; but Blaſphemies, Hereſies, Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, and ſuch ſins as more directly oppoſe God and his Worſhip: and theſe will the fear of God, where it is, eſpecially hunt out. This was the grace that made <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſeek the <hi>wealth of Iſrael,</hi> by making the Princes ſwear <hi>to Gods Covenant:</hi> this made him almoſt forget himſelf in zealous revenge againſt the Sabbath-breakers: all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> could not maintain this one ſin againſt that one godly Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Magiſtrates muſt be men <hi>dealing truly.</hi> 1 Affecting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, truth, and juſtice, which are the very ſinews of humane ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 2 Effecting it, by taking true pains, that the truth of every cauſe may be ſifted out, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.6. and receive a true ſentence, that the
<pb facs="tcp:40284:146"/> poor may not be born down with power and greatneſs, nor go away in a good cauſe diſappointed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.20. 3 Oppoſing with all their ſtrength, whatſoever is oppoſite unto truth: not ſuffering the truth to be clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and veiled by flouriſhing pleas, or ſhews of truth: but reſembling God, whoſe Judgement-ſeat is ſaid to be a <hi>throne of whit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1 They <hi>crowned him</hi> with a Crown of pure gold, ſet with Pearls and precious Stones: and theſe ſignified both the integrity of his Perſon, and the incorruption of his manners.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They gave <hi>him the book of the teſtimony:</hi> the book ſhewed that wiſdome is meet for a Ruler: and that it was the <hi>book of the Testimony,</hi> ſheweth, that 1 The moſt neceſſary wiſdome for a Magiſtrate, is the wiſdome of God: 2 That he muſt judge by Gods Book and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore muſt be learned in Gods Laws, and skilful in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Gods Statute-book: and 3 The Book was given him, that he might keep and preſerve it, and ſee the contents of it obſerved in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for he is a keeper of both the Tables.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They <hi>annointed him,</hi> to ſignifie the power and gifts of courage, magnanimity, and other ornaments ſit to attend Magiſtracy. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it notably preſerveth the honour of this Ordinance, when the perſon executing it, is as eminent in gifts and graces, as in place, and preheminence. I take not upon me to teach your Worſhips how to govern, but only declare how the Lord would every way have this Ordinance of his, and the bearers of it honoured, and what be the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ornaments which draw the eyes, and reverent reſpect of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours upon you.</p>
                  <p>Now more ſeverally, your gravity (Reverend Judge) your huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, your equity in the juſt and unpartial carriage of cauſes, your zeal againſt vice and vicious perſons, who gladly decline your cenſure, your diligent frequenting the houſe of God, your care of promoting the pure Worſhip of God, which you witneſſe by your new erection dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated thereunto, have got you a worthy and due regard through all
<pb facs="tcp:40284:147"/> our Country, wherein though I bee but a ſtranger, yet muſt hee bee more ſtrange that meeteth not with the report of your vertues. And you noble Knight (whom I have known of longer time) will give me leave to conceal a great part of that I conceive of your worth. You do well to imitate your worthy Parents, one of whom hath left you with a fair inheritance, a pattern (as I have heard) of many vertues, from which you may not depart: the other, God hath yet left unto you, to follow you with motherly advice and counſel, to ſet before you ſtill the beſt Patterns: but above all, the glaſs of Gods word, the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent obſervation whereof, if you adde to the other excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your mind, perſon, and eſtate, you ſhall give a number of your years and rank leave to come behind you, and follow you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus humbly craving pardon for my boldneſs, I commend this Book to your Worſhips acceptance, which for the whole argument (containing a plain unfolding of the moſt grounds and main pillars of our Religion) is worthy your reſpect; and your ſelves, with your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Ladies, and hopeful Children, together with all your ſtudies and endeavours for the Church or Common-wealth, to the rich bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God: who fill your hearts with heavenly wiſedome, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you both blameleſs till his appearing, Amen.</p>

Thus is it uſed, Pſal. 78.2. <hi>I will open my mouth in a Parable, I will declare ſentences of Old:</hi> Job 33.1. <hi>Behold I have opened my mouth; my tongue hath ſpoken in my mouth: my words are in the uprightneſs of my heart, and my lips ſhall ſpeak pure knowledge.</hi> Yea, our Lord Jeſus himſelf, when hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his moſt heavenly Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.2. is ſaid to <hi>open his mouth, and ſay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whence, 1 wee have the Doctrin in the Sermon following commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto us, to be for the matter of it grave, and high, and neerly concerning the ſalvation of men: wherein are laid down the main grounds of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and whatſoever wee are to beleeve concerning Chriſt unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as wee ſhall ſee when wee come to open the ſeveral points.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Wee are ſecretly incited, that ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt hath opened the mouth of ſuch a worthy inſtrument, wee are alſo to open our ears, yea, our hearts, to let in the matter following, that as it proceeded out of the treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a good and ſanctified heart, ſo wee alſo may hide it in good hearts, as in good treaſures, to bring it forth as our needs and occaſions ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>

                     <p>Now the Sermon following conſiſteth of three parts.
<note place="margin">The parts of the Sermon, three.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt is an entrance or preface, in the two firſt verſes, 34, 35.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Propoſition or Narration; that Jeſus Chriſt was the Meſſias now exhibited in the fleſh, and <hi>Lord of all,</hi> verſ. 36.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 A confirmation of that narration, partly from the Apoſtles; and partly from the Prophets witneſs. 1 For the Apoſtles, they witneſſed of ſuch facts of Chriſt as argued him, Firſt, a <hi>Prophet,</hi> verſ. 37, 38. <hi>Who went about doing good, and healing, &amp;c.</hi> for theſe Miracles ſerved to confirm his heavenly doctrin.

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>w, and hanged on a tree:</hi> which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his ſacrifice. Thirdly, a <hi>King,</hi> proved by three Arguments: 1 By his <hi>riſing</hi> from death, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40, 41. 2 By ſending out his Apoſtles to preach, <hi>v.</hi> 42. 3 By his coming to judge all fleſh, <hi>ver.</hi> 42.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The ſame truth is confirmed by the witneſs of all the Prophets: <hi>ver.</hi> 43. In the Preface <hi>Peter</hi> maketh way unto his Doctrin three ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 By removing from himſelf an imputation of levity, and ſudden change of his mind, which might otherwiſe have been objected againſt him; for all men knew that he being a Jew had been very reſpective, leſt at any time he ſhould come near an Heathen or Gentile (ſuch as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company were) for ſo it appeareth by his anſwer in the Viſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. yea and after his viſion he was full of doubts whether he might adventure into their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, till the Lord adds to his viſion, a voyce; bidding him go in to <hi>Cornelius, doubting nothing,</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore moſt ingenuouſly in the firſt place acknowledgeth an error that had ſtuck by him: namely, in accounting now after Chriſts death and Reſurrection (whereby hee brake down all partition walls) ſuch as were uncircumciſed, an unclean company, and like Doggs and Swine to whom holy things might not be caſt and offered.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That the Lord had removed this error, manifeſtly teaching him, both by viſion and voyce, that his grace did now extend it ſelf over all ſorts of men; and therefore that he came not of his own head, moved by remerity, or raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but upon good ground, to teach even the Gentiles the myſteries of their ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 He gets not audience only and attention, but authority alſo to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; by ſhewing what a good conceit he had of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company; that he had not now to deal with prophane, and lewd perſons, but ſuch as the Lord had ſanctified to himſelf, according to the viſion and voyce, <hi>What or whom the Lord hath ſanctified, account not thou prophane,</hi> verſ. 15.</p>
                     <p>Whence, 1 <hi>We have in this holy man a Map of Humane frailty,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſerv. 1. A Map of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty in the Apoſtle.</note> 
                        <hi>in which wee may ſee how heavie the beſt are to their duties:</hi> for was it not long before given <hi>Peter</hi> in charge to teach the Gentiles? was not his commiſſion large enough, when among other Diſciples he was diſmiſſed by Chriſt himſelf to <hi>teach,</hi> not only the Nations, but <hi>all Nations.</hi> Had not he heard often from the mouth of Chriſt, and read in the Writings of the Prophets, that the Gentiles muſt bee called in, that the Tents of the Church muſt bee enlarged, her Curtains ſtretched out, and that their own ſound muſt go over all the world? yet <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had forgotten all this; and as though Chriſt had not been come, or as if himſelf had never converſed with him, he would ſtill uphold the difference of peoples which his Mr. had deſtroyed, confine ſalvation to the Jews only, as if Chriſt had not been a common Saviour of Jews and Gentiles; he muſt have new viſions, and voyces, to lift him up to his duty, or elſe he cannot be brought ſo much as to acknowledge it.</p>
                     <p>Let us look upon this example to condemn our own corruption by it, yea to watch over it; leſt following (as we are too proue) the ſtream of it, we be carried away from the moſt eſſential duties, which by our calling, either
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:40284:149"/> general, or particular, are by God enjoyned us. Let the Popiſh guides alſo look upon this example, and tell us whether <hi>Peter</hi> erred not, 1 In judgement. 2 After Chriſts promiſe. 3 In a weighty matter; forgetting his commiſſion, and calling, yea, and the calling and ſalvation of the whole body of the Gentiles; all which he ſailed in. And then whether it be a ſound ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, In that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſecretly implyeth an acknowledgement of his error,
<note place="margin">A pattern of ſpecial grace in the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</note> 
                        <hi>We have in him a worthy pattern of a ſpecial grace to be practiſed of us all;</hi> namely, upon better grounds, to lay aſide any error in judgement, or practice, although never ſo long held, or ſtifly maintained of us before; and not be aſhamed to profeſs that we ſo doe: which vertue is a ſound fruit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and argueth a good heart, which is in love with the truth for it ſelf; and eſteemeth it above his own eſtimation: the obſerving whereof would cut off infinite controverſies which could never bee carried and continued with ſuch burning heat in the Church of God, if the contention were not many times more for victory, than for truth; and rather leſt error ſhould bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, than that truth ſhould triumph over it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In this Preface every Miniſter is taught, wiſely to cut off and remove ſuch le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So did the Apoſtle here, and not without cauſe; ſeeing the acceptance of the perſon of a Miniſter, is a great furtherance for the entertainment of his doctrine, not that the faith of God ought to be had in reſpect of perſons; but becauſe mans weakneſs carrieth him beyond his duty herein.</p>
                     <p>And again, Satan and his inſtruments ſeek exceptions againſt their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe doctrine is without exception: well knowing, that where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not firſt received, hardly will any doctrine from him bee embraced, Matth. 10.14. <hi>He that receiveth not you, nor your words.</hi> Whence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was conſtrained to be much and often in the juſtifying of his perſon, calling, and converſation; becauſe to hinder his doctrine, the falſe Apoſtles by all theſe laboured to bring him into contempt. Nay our Lord Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was forced often to averre his perſon to be Divine, his calling to bee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and his converſation holy and without ſin: becauſe the <hi>Jewes</hi> were ever hence diſgracing his doctrine, becauſe of the meanneſs of his appearance. Now whoſoever would retain reverence and authority among his people, muſt ſhew forth, 1 Conſcience of his duty. 2 Love to his peoples ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. 3 A wiſe and unblameable carriage and converſation: theſe things if he doe not, he hath more diſgraced himſelf, than his people can.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of a truth, I perceive that God accepteth not of perſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>perſon,</hi> is not here meant the ſubſtance of man, or the man himſelf: but the outward quality, appearance, or condition, which being offered to the eye, may make a man more or leſs reſpected; ſuch as are wealth, honour, learning, parentage, beauty, or ſuch like, here called the <hi>face</hi> of a man: for which God accepteth not, nor rejecteth any man, <hi>Job</hi> 34.19. <hi>Hee accepteth not the perſons of Princes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu) nor regardeth the rich more than the poor, they being all the work of his hands.</hi> And applied to the Apoſtles purpoſe, is as if he had ſaid, I now indeed clearly perceive, that the Lord hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any dignity, or priviledge in any people, above another, that hee ſhould pour his grace upon one more than another, upon the Jew above the Gentile;
<note place="margin">Why God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth not of perſons.</note> upon the circumciſion above the uncircumciſion; upon the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, above the reſt of the Nations and Kindreds throughout the world.

                     <p n="3">3 It were a moſt unequal valuation to compare, and much more to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer things which are in no proportion of goodneſs, to the things which are undervalued: for between temporal and eternal, heavenly and earthly things can bee no proportion. 4 He which hath forbidden us to judge by the falſe, and crooked rule of ſence, ſight, reaſon, and ſuch things as are before us, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not himſelf do ſo: both which points are plainly reproved, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. The Lord biddeth <hi>Samuel</hi> (being to chuſe one of the Sons of <hi>Iſhai</hi> to bee King) <hi>look not on his countenance, nor on the height of his ſtature:</hi> and addeth this as a reaſon: <hi>for God ſeeth not as man ſeeth; man looketh on the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance but the Lord beholdeth the heart.</hi>

If it bee ſtill asked, what cauſe then was there why this people ſhould above all other bee choſen to partake in the Covenant of life, the Lord himſelf directly anſwereth, that there was no cauſe without himſelf that moved him hereunto, it was only his free love, and meer good will: <hi>The Lord loved you, becauſe hee loved you,</hi> Deut. 7.8.</p>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Objection anſwereth it ſelf: for in that all lie alike in the ſame maſs, and all are corrupted, it is plain that election and reprobation depend not upon any thing outward: for ſeeing matter enough to condemn all, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſold unto ſin; and no more matter of love in thoſe whom he chuſeth, than thoſe whom he refuſeth; we muſt needs conclude with the Apoſtle, that <hi>Hee chuſeth freely whom hee will, and whom he will he juſtly reprobateth and refuſeth</hi> Rom. 9.18. If it be here alledged that it ſeemeth hard that thoſe that are all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be ſo unequally dealt with.

                     <p>Object. <hi>But when God judgeth men according to their works, doth hee not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of men by outward things, and did not the Lord accept perſons when hee reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Abel <hi>and his ſacrifice; but to</hi> Cain <hi>and his ſacrifice had no respect?</hi>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. If God accept not, nor reject men for outward reſpects, no more muſt thoſe who would be like unto him. And hence ſundry ſorts of men are to be inſtructed in their duty. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Magiſtrates, who are Gods Vicegerents, and called gods, yea called by God to execute his Judgements, muſt beware of reſpecting perſons in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Moſes</hi> appointing Judges over the people, ſendeth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with this charge, <hi>Yee ſhall have no reſpect of perſons in judgement, but ſhall hear the ſmall as well as the great: yee ſhall not fear the face of man; for the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Gods.</hi> This corruption yeelded unto, makes a man <hi>ſay to the</hi> wicked, <hi>thou art righteous,</hi> and layeth him open, not only to the curſe of God, but even <hi>to the curſe of the people,</hi> Prov. 24.24. Nay more, hee maketh God, ſo farre as lyeth in him, a patron of iniquity, a juſtifier of the wicked, a taker of the ungodly by the hand, a condemner and puniſher of the innocent: for he pronounceth ſentence from God, and faſtneth that upon the Lord, which the Lord abhorres.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Miniſters who are the mouth and Meſſengers of God, muſt take heed of this baſe ſin of accepting the face or perſons of men; ſo as for fear or flattery they hide or betray any part of the truth of God. The <hi>Herodians</hi> could ſay, that Chriſt taught the <hi>way of God truly, becauſe he respected not the face of man,</hi> Mark 12.14. What a ſtraight charge giveth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>preferre no man in his miniſtry, and doe nothing with partiality?</hi> 1 Tim. 5.21. It was a worthy commendation of <hi>Levi,</hi> that the <hi>law of truth</hi> was in his mouth, iniquity was not found <hi>in his lips,</hi> he <hi>walked with God in peace and equity,</hi> and ſo <hi>turned many from iniquity,</hi> Mal. 2.6. Whereas on the contrary, what a wicked thing it is to preach <hi>for hire, reward, favour, and yet lean upon the Lord:</hi> See in <hi>Micha</hi> 3.11.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Ordinary Profeſſors may not accept perſons. 1 Not in <hi>civil things.</hi> For when elections, offices, and common benefits, are paſſed and beſtowed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for friendſhip, money, kindred, favour, or entreaty: this is the ruine of all ſocieties, and a bringer in of all corruption: eſpecially, when men have taken oathes to a Corporation to the contrary, the ſin is like an infolded diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe more incurable and dangerous. 2 In matters of <hi>religion</hi> much leſs, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this ſin be many ways committed. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 To have the faith of God in reſpect of perſons, which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> noteth in this inſtance, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.2. <hi>When a man with a gold ring, or goodly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel,</hi> be he never ſo wicked, is magnified and advanced above another, who is not ſo outwardly gaudy; but inwardly arrayed with the white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſts righteouſneſs; and adorned with the Jewels of faith, love, holineſs, and ſincerity, which the world taketh little knowledge of.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To accept the word, becauſe he is a man of pomp that bringeth it, a rich man, or a friend: the <hi>Corinths</hi> were juſtly blamed for partial hearing, and holding, ſome to <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome to <hi>Apollos,</hi> ſome to Cephas, 1 Cor. 3.4. <hi>who is</hi> Paul, <hi>who is</hi> Apollos, <hi>who is</hi> Cephas, <hi>are not they all Miniſters by whom yee beleeve? Ahab</hi> will not hear <hi>Micah,</hi> becauſe he hateth his perſon, but he ſhall juſtly fall for it at <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> 1 King. 22.37.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 To reject the profeſſion of religion becauſe it wanteth countenance, and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40284:150"/> credit at moſt hands, and a few poor ones only receive it. Many Proteſtants can hear us juſtly confute the Popiſh doctrine and practice; in that they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their religion in reſpect of perſons, that is, of the outward appearance of it; becauſe they pretend a perpetual ſucceſſion, conſent of Councils, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Princes, antiquity, univerſality, the moſt part of <hi>Europe</hi> having ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taken the mark of the Beaſt in their hands and foreheads: and yet the ſame men ſee not how themſelves are ſlipt into the ſame Popiſh error, that refuſe one courſe becauſe it wants outward ſupporters and props; and chuſe that by which they may ſwim with the ſtream: they hate Popery becauſe the Laws hate it, and love religion becauſe it is now crowned, eſtabliſhed, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their proſperity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 To diſdain the perſons of poor profeſſors: which is ſo general, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a ſin, as that nothing can they doe or ſpeak, but it paſſeth much unjuſt cenſure: nay things by them exceeding well and holily performed, are ſo farre from being drawn into example, as that thereby they can bee traduced. Wherein yet they are conformed unto the Son of God, the head of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, whoſe powerful doctrine, and mighty works were carped at, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, becauſe they knew his Father, his Mother, himſelf at the beſt but a Carpenters Son, not brought up at ſtudy and learning. For example, how was that great work of healing a man miraculouſly, ſo farre from affecting the <hi>Jews,</hi> as that they fell very foul, and were <hi>angry with him?</hi> and the reaſon is rendred by our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.23, 24. <hi>Becauſe they judged according to the outward appearance, and not with righteous judgement</hi> concerning him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 For profeſſors themſelves to look too bigge upon ſome meaner ones as they conceive, but by the Goſpel, members of Chriſt, and his Kingdom as well as they: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. Chriſt who <hi>preached to the poor</hi> as well as the rich, hath ſpoken to their hearts as well as their own; and hath equalled them, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps made them ſuperiour in graces to the other. Now ſhould not thoſe that profeſs God, herein reſemble him, who though he bee high and excellent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting eternity, and dwell in the high and holy place; yet he looks to the humble and lowly, yea and <hi>dwels alſo with him that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. To think too baſely of him whom God chuſeth, is to erre from Gods righteous judgement: and what can the blind world doe more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to the profeſſion, than to paſs by the graces of God as not knowing what they mean?</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Not to ſpeak here of Popiſh ſpirits, who ſeek to diſgrace our Religion, becauſe Artificers, and ſimple women are (as they ſay) Scripturers: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that in Chriſt neither <hi>male nor female</hi> are rejected, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. and that God chuſeth even weak and fooliſh things to confound the wiſe and mighty; and the poor ones of the world to be rich in faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. If God accept not perſons for outward reſpects,
<note place="margin">If outward things could bring us into acceptance with God, we might ſee our hearts on them.</note> why ſhould any outward thing gain our hearts, our affections, our ſtudies; ſeeing if we could gain them all, we are never the further in Gods books? Many are ready to ſay, oh, God loveth them; and judge themſelves highly in ſavour, becauſe he ſuffereth his light to ſhine upon their habitations; their hands find out wealth, they are encreaſed in poſſeſſions, and proſpered in their labours, peaceable in their houſes without fear: therefore doth pride compaſs them as a chain. But with one word doth the wiſe man ſhatter down all the pillars of this fooliſh erection, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. <hi>No man knoweth love or hatred, of all that is before them.</hi> And if outward things could commend a man to God, <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Nebuchadnezzar, Nero,</hi> and ſuch wicked Tyrants had been higheſt in favour with him; whoſe feathers hee pluckt, whoſe pride hee brought low, making them ſpectacles of his vengeance to all the world, who for their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward greatneſs had been the terrours of the world. And yet much leſs ſhould theſe things ſwell the hearts of men with pride above others, who perhaps
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:40284:151"/> have a better part in Heaven than themſelves. The proneneſs unto which ſin the Lord perceiving, he hath expreſly charged, that the <hi>rich man ſhould not glory in his riches, nor the ſtrong man in his strength,</hi> Jer. 9.24. but, if <hi>any man glory, let him glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me.</hi> All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejoycing is not good: that is, is hurtful and perilous; beſides the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch vain boaſting; common experience ſhewing, that the higher ſcale is always lighteſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">We muſt ſtand naked in Gods Iudgement, ſeeing no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing can commend us to him.</note> 
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. If God accept no man for outward things, then when we enter into Gods judgement we ſhall appear naked, ſtript of all outward reſpects, as birth, riches, learning, crowns, and kingdoms; theſe in mens Courts are good advocates, but before Gods Tribunal, may not plead, and cannot help. No condition of life, no degree, no outward quality, no calling, no not the outward calling of a Chriſtian (if thou haſt no more) ſhall ſtand by thee; ſtript ſtark naked ſhalt thou be; figge-leaves can hide thy ſhame no longer: only the Wedding Garment can now cover thee from the conſuming wrath of God. A garment not laid with gold, ſilver, pearls, but ſtraked with bloud, yea dyed red in the bloud of the Lamb. The High Prieſt upon pain of death might never enter into the Sanctuary, but he muſt firſt be ſprinkled with the bloud of Bullocks, figuring the bloud of Chriſt. Never dare thou to appear in the Sanctuary of Gods holineſs, without this garment of thy elder brother, in which alone thou getteſt the bleſſing, as <hi>Jacob</hi> gat the bleſſing in <hi>Eſaus</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: from this alone the Lord <hi>ſavoureth a ſavour of reſt,</hi> Gen. 27.26.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, from this conſideration that God is no reſpecter of perſons, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle admoniſheth ſuperiours to moderation and equal dealing with their inferiours, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.9. and inferiours to ſilence, and contentation under the tough dealing of their ſuperiours, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.25.</p>

                     <p>And under <hi>working of righteouſneſſe,</hi> is comprehended the obſervation of the duties of the ſecond Table: whereby the former being moſt of them inward, are outwardly manifeſted and juſtified: ſo as under both is compriſed the whole duty of man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandements, for this is the whole man:</hi> All thoſe ten words wherein the Lord hath included an admirable perfection of wiſdome and holineſs, are here contracted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two, 1 <hi>The fear of God.</hi> 2 The <hi>keeping of his Commandements:</hi> and therefore when the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures would grace this or that holy man with full commendation, as it were with his whole ſtile, be commonly joyneth theſe two together, unto which nothing more can bee added: <hi>Job</hi> was a juſt man, <hi>fearing God, and abſtaining from evil,</hi> Job 1.8. <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were <hi>juſt before God,</hi> and <hi>walked in all the Ordinances of God</hi> without reproof, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6.</p>
                     <p>Here two points are to be conſidered, 1 Who is a religious man; hee that <hi>feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſſe.</hi> 2 What is his priviledge; <hi>he is accepted of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Religion is a binder, and thence hath his name, for it both bindeth <hi>man unto God,</hi> as the former of the points will ſhew: as alſo <hi>God unto man,</hi> as the latter
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40284:151"/> declareth. The former band knitting man unto God, is the <hi>fear of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fear of God.</note> which is a peculiar gift of the Spirit of God, whereby the Regenerate fear God for himſelf, not ſo much that they bee not offended and puniſhed by him, as that they do not offend him. An excellent grace both in regard of the excellent <hi>Object,</hi> and of the excellent <hi>Uſe</hi> of it through the whole life.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The right <hi>object</hi> of our fear, is God himſelf, who is, 1 Omnipotent, of power to do whatſoever he wil, <hi>who is able to caſt body and ſoul into Hell, fear him,</hi> Matth. 10.28. 2 Omnipreſent, hee is all an eye, beholding our Thoughts, Words, and Deeds, of which hee is both a witneſs and a Judge, 3 Full of Majeſty, which even in a mortal Man ſtrikes us with reverence. 4 Full of Grace and Bounty, wee ſtand in need of his Favour and Bounty every Moment, who can turn us out of all at his pleaſure. In all which reſpects wee ought to <hi>make him our dread,</hi> Iſa. 8.13. But above all in that he hath been ſo good and gracious a Father unto us through his Chriſt, we ought to fear to offend him, and ſo turn his love into diſpleaſure againſt us.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Now the <hi>Vſe</hi> of this Grace is manifold. As, 1 To beat down pride and high-mindedneſs, againſt which it is a notable medicine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Bee not high-minded, but fear,</hi> Prov. 3.7. <hi>Bee not wiſe in thine own eies, but fear God:</hi> this grace maketh a man come low before the Lord, as <hi>Jacob</hi> fearing <hi>Eſau. Gen.</hi> 33.3. <hi>Came and bowed ſeven times before him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 To cauſe a man to renounce, and reſtrain himſelf from ſin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fear of God and departing from evil, are often joyned together. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> could not commit the ſin with his Miſtreſſe, <hi>becauſe hee feared God:</hi> the Midwives <hi>feared God,</hi> and killed not the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Children: <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not exact upon, and oppreſs the people, as the former Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that were before him, <hi>becauſe hee feared God:</hi> and whereas the wicked mans ſervile fear keepeth him often from open ſins, but not from ſecret; from groſs ſins, but not from ſmaller; and this of Pain, not of Conſcience: this grace maketh a man hate <hi>Pride, Arrogancy, and every evill way,</hi> Prov. 8.1, 3. never ſo ſmall, and never ſo ſecret.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 To deſtroy falſe and fleſhly fears which foil every good duty, and lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to many ſins and judgements:
<note place="margin">Quod ſupra homines eſt time, &amp; homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes te non terrebunt.

                     <p>The Jews were afraid leſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould come and take their nation; and therefore Chriſt muſt dye: but the <hi>Romans</hi> not long after came with a powder, and took their Nation, and ſo diſ-peopled and diſperſed them, as they could never bee gathered into a nation till this day.

And in a word, to fence the heart, which is as the market-place of a City, againſt temptation, in which ſpecial uſe it is called <hi>a Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of life</hi> to eſcape the ſnares of death.</p>
                     <p>By all this that hath been ſpoken, every man that would ſeem religious, ought to labour above all things for this worthy Grace, which God ſpecially beſtoweth upon his Children, with whom hee maketh his new Covenant, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts never to depart from mee,</hi> ſaith the Lord.

                     <p>The laſt words in the deſcription <hi>[according to the preſcript of Gods Law)</hi> ſhew, that then a work is righteous,
<note place="margin">Juſte agere eſt agere ex prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripto juris.</note> when it is framed according to the right rule of the Law of God, it being the only perfect rule of all righteouſneſs: Mens Laws are rules alſo, but imperfect, and no further, yet ſo far bind as they are agreeable unto Gods.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The ſecond point is the working of righteouſneſs: wherein, 1 The Order. 2 The Manner.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Order</hi> is in the words, firſt, <hi>To fear God,</hi> and then <hi>to work righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> all the duties of love muſt bee founded in Faith, and in the fear of God; for whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin: and the fear of God is the very ſeed and life of all true obedience; which the wiſe man implyeth, when hee calleth it the <hi>head</hi> and <hi>beginning</hi> of wiſdome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.7. that look as all ſenſe floweth from the head; ſo all heavenly ſenſe and motion from the fear of the Lord. Which ſheweth, that many men begin at the wrong end in the matter of their obedience: ſome think they do. God high ſervice, if they come to Church, ſay ſome prayers, hear a Sermon: things not to bee diſ-allowed: but know not how far they are from pleaſing God herein, becauſe they bring not hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with Faith and Repentance, nor ſouls poſſeſſed with Hope, Love, and the true knowledge of God; without which, the Lord accounteth their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices but maimed, and profeſſeth his hatred againſt them: others place all their Holineſs and Obedience in the works and duties of the ſecond Table: If they bee liberal to the poor, juſt in their dealing, ſober and civil in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, though they live in groſs ignorance of God and his Word, utterly careleſs of the waies and worſhip of God, yet conceive themſelves in as good caſe as any other man; which is all one as to account that man a living man who hath no head, the fear of God being to true religion, even as the head to the body of a man: beſides that they thruſt the ſecond Table into the place of the firſt, inverting the order of God; yea, they pull and break aſunder the two Tables, which the Lord hath ſo neerly conjoyned.</p>
                     <p>Now for the right <hi>manner</hi> of working righteouſneſs, it appeareth in theſe rules.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It ſetteth all the rule before it, and endeavoureth in all, if it were poſſible,
<note place="margin">The right manner of working righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in four things.</note> to fulfil all righteouſneſs: for ſeeing all the Commandements of God are Truth and Righteouſneſs, they are all without exception to bee obſerved. And this, although it bee neceſſarily implied in the Text; yet is it elſe-where expreſſed, Deut. 5.29. <hi>Oh that there were in them ſuch an heart as to fear mee, and keep all my Commandements.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 A ſecond thing required is <hi>diligence,</hi> which muſt needs attend fear. How diligent a vertue fear is, appeareth in <hi>Jacob,</hi> who being to meet his Brother whom hee feared, could not <hi>ſleep all night:</hi> and in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who having a moſt difficult Commandement, to ſlay his Son, yet roſe early, and went three daies journey, without reaſoning the matter. But what moved him hereto? ſurely the Lord himſelf ſheweth the true cauſe, Gen. 22.12. <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not spared thine only Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Delight</hi> in the works of righteouſneſs, which alſo attendeth the fear of the Lord, Pſal. 112.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, hee delighteth greatly in his Commandements,</hi> both to think of them, to ſpeak of them, and to do them. Whereas the worldlings heart, ſpeech, and affection, is taken up with his Gain, Commodity, Rents, and income. For as the fear of God it ſelf is not a ſervile and ſlaviſh fear for puniſhment; no more is that obedience which proceedeth from it forced or wrung out: but as it is ſuch a fear as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40284:153"/> greatly in Gods Commandements; ſo the obedience is ſuch as is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from a <hi>willing people,</hi> like a free-will offering, which they muſt only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer whoſe <hi>heart encourageth</hi> them, and whoſe <hi>ſpirit maketh</hi> them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>Continuance</hi> in working: for this is another property of the true fear of God, that it reſpecteth not only <hi>all</hi> the Commandements, <hi>but always,</hi> Deut. 5.19. and ſeeing Gods fear is to keep the heart continually, and that man is bleſſed that <hi>feareth always,</hi> Prov. 23.17. this inſeparable fruit of it, <hi>working of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Prov. 28.24. muſt never wither or fail in the godly, who are exhorted to paſſe the <hi>whole time of their dwelling here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. to walk with God as <hi>Henoch</hi> did; and to have their <hi>converſation</hi> in Heaven, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.20. that is, their whole practice and courſe, and not a part of it only.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Motives to the practiſe of righteouſneſs.</note> Hence therefore is afforded another ground of exhortation, namely, that howſoever this is not ſuch a righteouſneſs as wherein we can ſtand before Gods Judgement Seat, not being every way anſwerable to the Laws perfection; yet we want not good reaſon to take up the practice of it in the manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: Seeing,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It is commanded by God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Offer to God the ſacrifice of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> 2 It pleaſeth him, and makes us alſo pleaſing unto him: for the former, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.7. The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs: the latter, is the latter words of the verſe in hand. 3 It maketh us like him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. Little children, he that doth righteouſneſs is <hi>righteous as he is righteous.</hi> 4 It is a mark of our regeneration, and a fruit of faith, eaſier diſcerned than it ſelf, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.10. In this are the children of God known, and the children of the Devil; <hi>He that doth not righteouſneſſe is not of God.</hi> 5 <hi>Much bleſſing is upon the head of the righteous</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>The bleſſing of God comes down upon him, and deſcends to his poſterity, God hath bleſſed him, and he ſhall be bleſſed in his perſon, in his eſtate, in his name, in his goods, in this life, and in the life to come. The bleſſing of men alſo comes upon him, the loyns of the poor bleſſe him; the Church of God bleſſeth him; yea, turn him what way hee will, the bleſſing of goodneſſe meeteth him every way: God giveth him according to the work of his hands often even here in this life; and if that ſhould fail, hee being marked for a member of the Church Militant, he ſhall be in due time removed into the holy mountain of Heaven; where he ſhall <hi>dwell</hi> who <hi>worketh righteouſneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 15.2. Thus much of the deſcription of a religious perſon: now of his priviledge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the priviledge of a religious man is, that a beleever of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Heaven, of any calling, ſex, or condition of life, <hi>is accepted of God.</hi> Where it may be asked,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whether God, whoſe grace is moſt free, be bound by any thing which any man can doe, to accept of him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, a man is to be conſidered two ways. 1 As in the ſtate of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature before his calling and converſion: and thus he hath nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy love, and nothing which provoketh not further hatred: here are no works which are not wicked and ſtained, ſuch a filthy puddle cannot ſend out one drop of ſweet water;
<note place="margin">How the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and work of a beleever can be accepted of God.</note> not any <hi>cleane thing can be brought out of ſuch filthineſſe;</hi> all this while can be no acceptance of the perſon, or of the work; no ſight of any preſent object in ſuch a party, nor any fore-ſight of any future faith or work whereby the Lord can be moved to accept him: for then the freedome of his grace ſhould be hindered.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 As he is converted, and now reconciled unto God, called by the Word, regenerated by the Spirit, and having his heart purified by faith. Now the Lord looking upon him, ſees him not as he was before, all naked, and lying
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40284:153"/> in his bloud and filthineſs; but beholding him in the face of his Chriſt, hee eſpieth his own image upon him, yea and his own workmanſhip upon him; and thus cometh the perſon to be firſt accepted. And then in the ſecond place, the work of ſuch a perſon cannot but be alſo pleaſing unto God, not for any worthineſs or perfection in it ſelf (for even the beſt work of the beſt man from imperfect faith, and imperfect knowledge, is ſo farre from meriting, as that it needeth pardon) but, 1 Becauſe it cometh from an accepted perſon: 2 Is a fruit of faith: 3 A teſtimony of obedience unto Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: 4 The imperfection and ſtain of it is covered and wiped away with Chriſts moſt abſolute obedience. And thus both the perſon, <hi>fearing God,</hi> and his <hi>working of righteouſneſſe,</hi> is accepted of God.</p>

Nay, even the Lord himſelf hath gone before us herein for example, who for the moſt part reſpecteth poor and mean ones to call them to partake of his grace, paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p n="3">3 This doctrine teacheth all ſorts of men, to turn their courſe from ſuch earneſt ſeeking after honours, profits, preferments, and ſuch things, which make men accepted amongſt men, and as eagerly to purſue the things which would bring them to be accepted of God; ſuch as are faith, fear of God, love of righteouſneſſe, good conſcience, and the like: which things bring not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into favour with God, but often get the approbation of men, at leaſt ſo farre as God ſeeth good for his children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17, 18. <hi>The kingdome of God is not meat and drink,</hi> that is, hath not ſuch need of ſuch indifferent things as theſe are, but <hi>righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> thoſe are the eſſential things to be reſpected of all ſuch as are the ſubjects of that Kingdome of grace.

                     <p>OF all other readings I follow this, not only as the plaineſt, but becauſe it moſt aptly knitteth this verſe with the former, as a clear proof of it. For having ſaid, that now he knew that whoſoever, whether Jew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, did now purely worſhip God, according to the preſcript of his Word, the ſame is accepted of him: he proveth this to be a truth, becauſe it is the ſelf ſame thing which God himſelf had of old publiſhed to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when he declared unto them, that peace and reconciliation was made between God and man by the means of Jeſus Chriſt, who is Lord, not of any one people or Nation, but <hi>Lord of all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Apoſtle doth not ſecretly oppoſe the miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of Chriſt: <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Miniſter of the Law to the Jews only, but Chriſt himſelf, and the Goſpel, is the power of <hi>God</hi> to ſalvation to <hi>every beleever,</hi> firſt <hi>to the Jew, and then to the Grecian:</hi> and now God is not the <hi>God of the Jew only,</hi> but even of the Gentiles alſo, according to that heavenly ſong of the Angels, when Chriſt appeared to throw down that partition wall which ſtood between the Jew and Gentile; wherein they aſcribed not only all the glory unto God, but proclaimed peace to all the earth. In one word, that Jeſus Chriſt is our peace, and <hi>Lord of all,</hi> is the ſcope of this whole Sermon, and of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as after remaineth to be ſhewed in <hi>verſ.</hi> 43.</p>
                     <p>The former part of this verſe hath two general points to bee explained: the former, touching the <hi>peace</hi> here ſpoken of: the latter, concerning the <hi>preaching</hi> or declaring of it.
<note place="margin">By peace what is meant.</note> In the former muſt be conſidered, 1 What this <hi>peace</hi> is: 2 How it is by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Firſt, by <hi>peace,</hi> among the Hebrews and Greeks, is meant all proſperity and happineſſe; for both of them in their ſalutations (though with ſome difference) prayed for peace to the parties ſaluted, that is, all good ſucceſs from God the fountain of mercy. And includeth in it, 1 Peace with God: 2 Peace with man, both with a mans ſelf, and others: 3 Peace with all the creatures of God, ſo farre forth as that none of them ſhall bee able to hurt him further than God thinketh good for his exerciſe; and in this peace ſtandeth true happineſſe.</p>

                        <note place="margin">1 Peace with God by three things.</note> Firſt he wrought our peace with <hi>God,</hi> from whom our ſin had ſundered and ſeparated us, three ways. 1 By interpoſing himſelf between his Fathers anger and us, who durſt not come near him, 2 By ſatisfying in our ſtead all his juſtice through his bloud; thereby removing all enmity, cancelling all hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writings which might have been laid againſt us; and beſtowing on us a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſſe in which God is delighted to behold us. 3 By appearing now for us in Heaven, and making requeſts for us: in all which hee cannot but be heard, being the Son of his Fathers love in whom he is well pleaſed, and, for him, with us his members.</p>

<note place="margin">3 Peace with the Creatures.</note> all his Creatures are armed againſt us, to take his part, and revenge their Creators wrong upon us; by Chriſt even this curſe is alſo removed: and it is an expreſſe branch of the New Covenant, that the Lord will work our peace with the Creatures, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>And in that day will I make a Covenant, for them, with the wild beaſts, and with the fowls of the heaven, and with that which creepeth upon the earth:</hi> For <hi>God</hi> being in league with us, even the <hi>ſtones in the field,</hi> and <hi>the beaſts in the field ſhall be at league with us alſo,</hi> Job 5.23.

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>this point affordeth ſome main differences between true and falſe peace,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true and falſe peace.</note> by which every man may be helped in the examination of his eſtate. For, 1 sound Chriſtian peace is always a fruit of righteouſneſſe, and by unrighteouſneſſe is unſetled and diſquieted: but the peace of the wicked is for moſt part a fruit
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40284:155"/> of iniquity, and by it is never diſturbed; but for the time, the more ſin, the more peace, as in a number of ſinners might bee inſtanced.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Peace by Chriſt ariſeth from ſorrow for ſin: whence our Saviour coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth mourners bleſſed: but worldly peace, from the fruition of ſome world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delight or other.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Whoſoever then would not bee deceived in his peace, let him not own any out of Chriſt, let him look that his joy bee helped out of ſorrow, that it bee a fruit of righteouſneſs, and rooted in the heart; for then it is laſting for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ever comfortable. But let thy peace bee never ſo great, and the light of God ſhine never ſo bright upon thy habitation, and yet thou haſt never been troubled with the ſight of thy ſin (as many profeſs they never were) if it can dwell with iniquity, as many jolly fellows who make bold Covenants with Hell and Death, if it ſtabliſh not the heart with aſſured hope and comfort in all well doing; all this is but a brawn of heart, a laughing madneſs and frenzy; and even in the crying <hi>of this peace commeth deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.3. and let all that fear to bee at war with God, beware of this ungodly and diſhonourable peace; which is the moſt general peace in the world at this day: the guiſe of which is, then to laugh and rejoyce moſt, when Chriſt is departed, as himſelf witneſſeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.20.</p>

                     <p>Now in the ſecond place,
<note place="margin">Chriſt was preached to Iſrael, two waies.</note> wee are to conſider the <hi>Preaching of it to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael. Where two things are to bee explained: 1 <hi>How</hi> Chriſt was preached unto the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> 2 <hi>Why</hi> hee was ſo preached unto them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former, Chriſt was Preached to <hi>Iſrael</hi> two waies: 1 by the <hi>word,</hi> or promiſe. 2 by <hi>deed,</hi> or type.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> the main promiſe of all concerning this truth, was that which (after it was by Gods own mouth once delivered unto <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe, &amp;c.</hi>) was ſo often repeated to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Gen.</hi> 12.3.

                     </p>
                     <p>Again, Chriſt was <hi>by deed or type,</hi> preached our peace in the whole Levitical Prieſthood: for all that Ceremonial Worſhip, all their Sacrifices, Oblations, Altars, yea, their Temple, Ark, and Propitiatory, reſembled, and pointed at Chriſt our peace: and yet further, their very Kings, and Kingdome, their Prieſts and Prophets, all of them not obſcurely reſembled Jeſus Chriſt, and preached him our peace; who as a <hi>King</hi> delivered his ſubjects from all the former bondage of forein power, and by his merit, and triumph, wrought out their peace: As a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> ſacrificed himſelf, and offered unto his Father a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice of peace for them: and as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> fully delivered from his Father the whole Doctrin of peace and reconciliation.

                        <hi>why was Chriſt preached our peace to the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>firſt;</hi> and why was that Doctrin renewed to them from time to time by the hand and miniſtery of the Prophets?</p>
                     <p>

                     <p n="2">2 Becauſe God had choſen them to bee a peculiar people, hee ſet them up above all nations, not onely in many other prerogatives, but in this, which was the chief of all (had they ſeen it) that the <hi>Oracles of God were committed unto them,</hi> Rom. 3.2. <hi>Hee gave his Laws to</hi> Jacob, <hi>his Covenants to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>hee dealt not ſo with every Nation, Pſal.</hi> 147.30. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> when hee had reckoned a number of the Jews advancements above the Gentiles, ſuch as were their Adoption, Covenant, Promiſes, Fathers, hee ſhutteth up all with the chief of all, in theſe words, <hi>of whom concerning the fleſh Chriſt came,</hi> Rom. 9.5. Now as that was the firſt, that hee came of them, ſo this is the next, that hee came unto them alone firſt, in the promiſes and types, then in his perſon and appearance, then in his Doctrin and miracles performed in his own perſon; adde hereto, that hee came to them in his life and death, and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:40284:156"/> laſtly, hee came firſt and alone to them in the Miniſtry and Miracles of his Holy Apoſtles, who muſt not go into the <hi>way of the Gentiles,</hi> nor <hi>turn themſelves to other Nations,</hi> till the Jews by deſpiſing that Grace offered, had made themſelves <hi>unworthy of life everlaſting:</hi> the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt firſt bee ſought up, and therefore (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid) <hi>it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the word of God ſhould firſt bee spoken unto them,</hi> Act. 13.46.</p>

                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. Whence wee may note, 1 <hi>The Divinity of Scripture,</hi> which foretelleth beforehand things which are to come to paſs many hundreths, yea, ſome thouſands of years after. The thing that foretelleth things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to come, which have no exiſtence in any cauſe, or ſign, muſt needs bee of God. Satan indeed can gueſs at ſome events, but which have ſome grounds in nature, or experience; or can foretell a thing to come which God hath revealed to him, or himſelf is made an executioner of, as in <hi>Saul:</hi> but to foretell a thing, or event meerly to come, is proper to God. Whence it neceſſarily followeth, that the Scripture, <hi>foreſeeing that God would juſtifye the</hi> Gentiles <hi>through faith,</hi> Gal. 3.8. that is, a thing to come to paſs almoſt two thouſand years after, muſt needs bee of God.</p>
                     <p>Again, it followeth as neceſſarily, that the Prophets in preaching, and the Holy Pen-men of God, ſpake and writ as they were moved by the Spirit of God, and directed by the immediate aſſiſtance of God, and therefore could not erre in any thing: for they foretold directly ſuch things, which both for matter, and manner, came to paſs many years after. <hi>Jacob</hi> in his will fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told; that the Scepter ſhould not depart from <hi>Judah</hi> till <hi>Shiloh</hi> came: this prophecy was not accompliſhed till above ſeventeen hundred years after the prediction: for not much above twenty years afore Chriſts birth, <hi>Herod</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came King of <hi>Judea,</hi> killed the whole Colledge of the Jews, called the <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim,</hi> wherein was the heir apparent of the Kings blood.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Cyrus</hi> was named by the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah,</hi> an hundred years before hee was born, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44.28. and of him propheſied, that hee ſhould build the Temple. The worthy King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> with his facts, were declared three hundred fifty nine years before he was born, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.2. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> propheſyed of the deſtruction of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and thereby the riſing of the Antichriſt, which was not accompliſhed till about the year four hundred ſeventy five after Chriſt. For whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was divided into Eaſtern, and Weſtern, the Weſtern which onely hindred the revelation of Antichriſt was in that year quite overthrown, and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf taken by the Gothes,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. Secondly, from hence alſo note <hi>The Antiquity of the Goſpel,</hi> in that it was Preached by the Prophets to the ancient Iſraelites; and known for the ſubſtance of it, not onely to the Apoſtles, and ancient Chriſtians, and beleevers, but to the Patriarks and Prophets, yea, even to <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, to all whom Chriſt was preached the <hi>Lord of all,</hi> and that bleſſed ſeed in whom all the Nations of the earth were to bee bleſſed. This Doctrin, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee called a new Teſtament,
<note place="margin">Our religion is the oldeſt religion, and Popery but a novelty.</note> is no new Doctrin. Let the Papiſts make a vain brag of Antiquity, and charge us with a new religion, the truth is, whereas the body of their doctrin was not known to the Prophets, nor Apoſtles, nor Beleevers for many hundred years after Chriſt; our doctrin
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:40284:156"/> is, that which God ſent <hi>to the children of Iſrael,</hi> and therefore is moſt ancient and true. And to prove this that I ſay, we will goe no further than our text. <hi>That doctrin which preacheth peace by Jeſus Chriſt, is the doctrin which was ſent to</hi> Iſrael; <hi>which we profeſſe at this day:</hi> but ſo is not Popiſh doctrin, which preacheth peace not by Chriſt, but by our ſelves, our merits, and ſatisfactions, and peace by the Popes Pardons, Bulls, and Abſolutions, and Indulgences; now theſe, with other dependences thereon, being the main points and pillars of their doctrin, were never preached to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nor ever by any of the Apoſtles, to the Church of God; but have crept in one after another many hundred years ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Let their own rule ſtand in force therefore with good will; if we cannot plead an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, we will lay no claim to the truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. Thirdly, hence we note, <hi>That there is but one way to ſalvation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">But one way to ſalvation.</note> and this was declared to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ſubſtance as well as to us, who went to Heaven by the ſame way which wee doe-There is but one Chriſt, one precious Faith, one and the ſame Goſpel common to all times, one common Salvation preached by the ſame Chriſt, <hi>who is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. who is <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the beginning,</hi> not actually, but by the efficacy of his Sacrifice, the vertue of which to come they laid hold on to ſalvation, as wee do upon it paſt, and accompliſhed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Abel</hi> beleeved, and received teſtimony that he was juſt before God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. Thus <hi>Noah</hi> was <hi>made heir of the righteouſneſſe which is by faith,</hi> Heb. 11.7. Every religion will not ſave thr profeſſors: there is but one way, and that a ſtrait one that leadeth to life. Wee come into the world one way, we depart many ways; ſo there is but one way to find life everlaſting, but many ways to loſe it: only Chriſt is the way, by his Doctrin, by his Merit, by his example, even the new and living way; his bloud is ever freſh, ever trickling down, and ever living: it quickneth them that walk in it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth them with new ſtrength: never any rent the veil but he: never any but he made a high way into the Holy of Holies in the higheſt Heaven: never any came to the Father, but by him, neither was peace ever preached in any other name but his, who is Lord over all, bleſſed for ever.</p>

In all the work of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption he ſerved and obeyed his Father, being ſent of his Father for this end, he was ſubject to the death, he prayed unto him, gave him thanks, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned obedience by the things he ſuffered, not as God equal to his Father, but as our Mediator and Surety: and yet by all theſe things he became our Lord, and the King of his Church. And herein the Apoſtles travel as in their main ſcope, to prove that Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Jews put to death, hath ſhewed himſelf the Lord of glory, and the true Meſſias, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.34. <hi>Let all the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>know aſſuredly, that God hath made that Jeſus, which they crucified, Lord</hi> and <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But how can Chriſt be the Lord of all, ſeeing many, yea the moſt will not obey him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Doth a King ceaſe to be the Lord of all his Country, becauſe ſome which were his ſubjects are gone out in rebellion againſt him? beſides, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſtandeth with his glory and grace, to ſuffer with patience the veſſels of wrath; yet at length he ſhews his power againſt them, in bringing forth his whole diſpleaſure upon them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> Hence in that Chriſt is in general Lord of all, we learn that all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are his, and therefore we muſt never uſe any of them without leave from him, or without return of praiſe and thanks unto him: none of them are ſanctified to our uſe, without the Word and Prayer. And if wee have leave from him, we ought in ſobriety to uſe them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.26. Eat whatſoever is ſold in the ſhambles, making no queſtion for conſcience ſake. Hence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it alſo, that he having an abſolute power over all, hee may doe with his own what he will: who ſhall hinder a Potter to frame one veſſel to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, another to diſhonour? which I ſpeak, becauſe many cannot endure to hear of a decree of reprobation, who muſt frame their judgement to his will who cannot but be juſt and good, and leave off to reaſon with God. Hence alſo he may make one rich, another poor, at his pleaſure: <hi>The rich and poor meet, this Lord maketh them both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, in that Chriſt is in ſpecial, Lord of his Church, ſundry things are to be noted: as firſt, <hi>That none can have Chriſt to be a Jeſus,</hi> that is, a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>who have him not for their Soveraign and Lord:</hi> whoſoever thou art that challengeſt him for thy Saviour, ſee thou acknowledge him thy Lord.</p>

                        <note place="margin">A man hath Chriſt his Lord by four things.</note> 
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> By the practice of four duties. 1 <hi>By preſerving in the heart a fear and reverence towards his perſon,</hi> Malac. 1.6. <hi>If I be a Lord, where is my fear?</hi> Lordſhip requires ſubjection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.11. <hi>He is thy Lord, and reverence thou,</hi> or bow unto <hi>him.</hi> Now this fear muſt proceed from love; for if any man love not the Lord Jeſus, let him be accurſed: and whereſoever this love is,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40284:157"/> it muſt needs bee attended with a fear to diſpleaſe him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>By profeſſing him to bee thy Lord:</hi> as ſervants by their livery, or cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, ſpeak, and proclaim to all men to whom they belong: ſo if Chriſt bee thy Lord, thou muſt not bee aſhamed of him; but bee ever ſpeaking of him, commending his goodneſs: thou muſt glory of ſuch a ſervice, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it thy greateſt honour, that thou art become his ſervant: thou muſt defend his name, where ever thou heareſt it called into queſtion: thou muſt ſuffer with him, and take part with him in affliction, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 4.13. an unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant is hee, that can bee dumb in his Maſters diſhonour, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if his Maſter be aſſaulted, and in danger, then to forſake him when hee hath moſt need of him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>By acknowledging thy ſelf to bee countable unto him for all thy waies, and for all thy receites:</hi>

Thus therefore muſt thou reaſon the caſe with thine own heart: what, am I now in my Maſters work, had I commandement from him, did his word or warrant ſet mee about the buſineſs which is now in my hands? Again, what gifts have I received of body, minde, wealth, authority, credit? I am to be countable for all: all the Talents I have are his: If I gain nothing, I am unprofitable: If I gain, I muſt be profitable unto him.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 It is his will <hi>that wee beleeve in him,</hi> Joh. 6.40.

Were not hee a notable Traytor, that being ſworn of the Kings guard, and profeſſing all ſervice to the King, ſhould inſtead of the Kings armes and coat, wear the enemies? ſo the thing it ſelf ſpeaketh againſt him, who profeſſeth Chriſt his Lord, and yet never appears or ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſtreet, or abroad, but in Satans livery: his ſwearing, his covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his filthineſs, his lying, his whole life lead in all intemperance, bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to whom hee hath given himſelf to obey.</p>

Thus
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40284:158"/> muſt wee obey Chriſt as a Lord, giving up our bodies and ſouls unto him, by living unto him, and dying unto him: and this is the Apoſtles ground, <hi>wee are the Lords,</hi> Rom. 14.7. and therefore none of us liveth unto himſelf, and none of us dyeth unto himſelf, but living and dying wee are the Lords: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what a trifling and mockery were it onely to yield him a title of Lord, or Maſter, and deny him his ſervice? <hi>Why call yee mee Maſter, Maſter, and do not the things I ſpeak?</hi> Luk. 6.46.</p>
                     <p>All which if it bee true, how few ſhall finde Chriſt a Saviour? for how few make him their Lord? few there are that eſteem this well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved above other well-beloveds; not a few are aſhamed of him and his profeſſion: many white-livered ſouldiers are daunted with <hi>Peter</hi> at the ſpeeches of ſilly and ſimple perſons: moſt men never look to the hands of this Lord, to acknowledge either receit of Talents, or return of accounts, feweſt of all obey him in faith, who yet are overcarried with preſumption of his favour; or in true ſanctification, though they can pretend it; or in patience, if they could get out of his hands, if it were by flying to the Devil for help. Well, if Chriſt have no more but a title of a Lord from thee, thou ſhalt have but a title of ſalvation from him, and not the thing it ſelf: and if a name that thou liveſt content thee, when thou art but dead, the time commeth, that when thou commeſt to ſeek thy name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number that are ſaved by him, thou ſhalt finde thy name left out of that role, and ſet in the number of thoſe that ſhall dye in their ſins.</p>

                     <p>Whence wee may ſhortly note, how the Lord findeth us when hee firſt ſetteth his love upon us, as far from meriting his love, as theſe <hi>Galilaeans</hi> who were a moſt wretched people: ſo as hee reſpecteth only his own grace in his reſpecting of us: which conſideration hee would often faſten upon his own ancient people the Jews; profeſſing to their face, that hee made no cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them for any worthineſs hee ſaw in them above other, for they were <hi>the worſt of all people,</hi> Deut. 9.4. and much leſſe can hee finde any worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to entitle a man to the heavenly <hi>Canaan:</hi> the freedome of this grace doth therefore ſhine out more clearly; and deſerveth that wee ſhould with much thankfulneſs, both acknowledge it, and alſo walk worthy of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hence is to be noted, <hi>That then men ſeaſonably hear of Chriſt, when they are prepared by</hi> John <hi>in the doctrin of repentance:</hi> when the Law hath killed, caſt us down, and made us guilty of the ſentence of death; then the Goſpel doth ſeaſonably propound the grace and mercy of God in Chriſt.

In like manner is he as ready to defend, and doe good unto ſuch as ſubject themſelves unto his Son, depend upon him, or ſuffer any thing for his ſake: they ſhall not repent them of their ſervice, ſeeing they ſerve ſo good a Lord.</p>
                     <p>The third thing in this calling of Chriſt to his Office, <hi>is the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to himſelf and others: in that hee was annointed with the Holy Ghoſt, and power.</hi> There were three ſorts of men that uſed to bee anoynted in the entrance unto their Office in the Old Teſtament, 1 Kings, 2 Prieſts.
<note place="margin">Anointing what it ſignified.</note> 3 Prophets. And this outward Ceremony ſignified two things: Firſt, their ordination or calling unto that Office: ſecondly, the promiſe of proportionable gifts for the performance: ſo as they were hereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<note place="margin">God never cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth any men to any place but he furniſheth him with gifts fit for it,</note> both that God hath choſen them to their office, as alſo that he would furniſh them unto it, and protect them in the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt is here ſaid to be alſo <hi>anointed;</hi> but not by man, as they, but by God: not with external oyl, but with the Holy Ghoſt, and with power: not cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially, and typically, but really and ſpiritually: not to any one of thoſe Offices, but to them all three: not receiving the ſign, but the thing ſignified; becauſe he was a real and true King, Prieſt, and Prophet of his Church, or whom all they were but types and ſhadows. In this anointing of Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both theſe things are ſignified and proved: 1 That he was ordained of God to the performance of this Office of Mediatorſhip, and conſecrated by God, to be the Meſſiah, that is, a ſpiritual King, Prieſt, and Prophet. 2. That he had poured out upon him, the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which gave him power, and furniſhed him for this Office; ſignified here by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>power:</hi> he receiving of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt power,</hi> whereby he performed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt work that ever was undertaken.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſts anointing and all other mens.</note> And here is to be obſerved <hi>a plain difference, between Chriſts anointing and all mens beſides.</hi> For whereas all other ſhadowed anoyntings were imperfect, and ſome had more gifts beſtowed, and ſome leſſe, but none all, nor all in one degree; Chriſt was perfectly anoynted, and even in his Human nature was adorned with gifts without meaſure: <hi>for God gave not him the Spirit by meaſure,</hi> Joh. 3.34. and not only with gifts, but <hi>all gifts</hi> in the higheſt degree, above <hi>all his fellows,</hi> Pſal. 45. men or Angels, in none of which ever dwelt the <hi>fulneſſe of the God-head bodily,</hi> as it did in him, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Whereas all other received gifts only for themſelves, and could not by their gifts make others Kings as they were, or Prieſts, or Prophets; Chriſt was ſo anoynted with the Holy Ghoſt and with power, that he could impart his gifts to others in ſuch manner, and meaſure, as they might become like unto himſelf: that look as the oyl which was poured out upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head, run down by his beard even to the skirts of his garment, and ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his whole body; even ſo ſuch abundance of grace was poured (as out of a full horn) upon Chriſt the head of his Church, as it diſtilleth from him to the ſweetning and perfuming of all his body, to make the ſame acceptable in the ſight of God. This the Evangeliſt expreſſeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Full of grace, of truth</hi> — and, <hi>of his fulneſſe we receive grace for grace:</hi> Coloſſ. 2.10. <hi>In him dwelleth the fulneſſe of the God-head bodily, and yee are compleat in him.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anoynting of Chriſt is two-fold. 1 In reſpect of his <hi>gifts:</hi> and with theſe he was anoynted by the very union of his two Natures into one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Wombe of the Virgin, from the firſt moment of his conception: for being admirably conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, his Humane nature was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted by the Divine, uniting it ſelf thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In reſpect of his <hi>calling</hi> to the exerciſe of thoſe gifts; and this was then
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:40284:161"/> compleat, when in the thirtieth year of his age at his Baptiſm, he was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly inaugurated by a voyce from Heaven, by the opening of the Heaven, and the deſcending of the Spirit of God in a viſible ſhape abiding upon him; not that be wanted the Spirit before, but that herein, as in the former reſpect alſo, a main difference might be put between his, and the anoynting of all that went before, who neither were anoynted in the Wombe, nor by the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Deity, nor by any other than material oyl: whereas hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with the Holy Ghoſt lighting upon him. And this was that which was propheſied before of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe hee hath anoynted me that I ſhould preach, &amp;c.</hi> In the expoſition of which place, when Chriſt begun his Miniſtery in <hi>Galilee,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears,</hi> Luk. 4.17.</p>

This is not a work to be committed to any King, or Emperour, nor the greateſt ſtate and Potentate in the earth, no nor to any Angel or Archangel in Heaven: none of theſe are fit for it, becauſe none are capable of this anoynting with the Holy Ghoſt and with power, but hee alone: who therefore is able to ſubdue all the Devils of Hell, though they come ruſhing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him all at once; to overthrow all the armies of Hell, Sin, Death, and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, aſſaulting himſelf and members with all their might and force: in a word, able to make his enemies (although principalities, and powers, never ſo mighty, and never ſo cruel) his very foot-ſtool.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 A more famous <hi>Prophet</hi> than <hi>Moſes</hi> is here anoynted: he was but a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the houſe, this is the Son: <hi>Moſes</hi> was but the Inſtrument, this is the Author of the word he delivereth: <hi>Moſes</hi> could teach but the ear, this Prophet teacheth the heart: <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Miniſter of the outward Circumciſion, this Circumciſeth, or rather baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire: let not us therefore deſpiſe him that <hi>ſpeaketh from heaven:</hi> for if <hi>they eſcaped not which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed</hi> Moſes <hi>that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:</hi> Heb. 12.25. And can we want reaſon? 1 In his anoynting we are commanded by a voyce from Heaven, <hi>hear him,</hi> Mat. 17.5. 2 He delivereth the whole will of his Father, we ſhall therefore be perfectly taught if we hear him. 3 We may ſafely reſt in his Doctrin, becauſe with him are the treaſures of wiſdome. 4 In a word, hee hath only the <hi>words of life everlasting, and whither ſhould we goe?</hi> Joh. 6.68.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hence we learn, <hi>That ſeeing every beleever is anoynted with Chriſt,</hi>

                        <hi>and in Chriſt, we muſt all be careful to find this holy oyl running down from the head upon us the members:</hi> 1 Joh. 2.27. <hi>The anoynting which yee receive of him
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:40284:162"/> dwelleth in you.</hi> And indeed our very name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> putteth us in minde that we muſt have our meaſure of that oyl of grace which was poured on Chriſt without meaſure: ſo as if we carry the name and title of Chriſt, wee muſt ſee that the nature and gifts of Chriſtians appear in our lives. <hi>Revel:</hi> 1.6. hee hath made us <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> unto God. And it was long before propheſied of the Church of the New Teſtament, that the ſons and daughters of it ſhall <hi>Propheſie,</hi> Joel 2.28. and all this by vertue of this anoynting.</p>
                     <p>Adde hereunto, that Chriſt is not perfectly anointed till his Church bee: for Chriſt may be ſaid to bee anointed two ways:
<note place="margin">Chriſtus totus vel Chriſtus myſticus.</note> either <hi>properly,</hi> in his own perſon, as conſidered in himſelf; or <hi>figuratively,</hi> by the uſe of Scripture, as he is the head of his Church, which joyned unto him, maketh up <hi>whole Chriſt,</hi> as the Fathers call him, or <hi>myſtical Chriſt.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> calleth Chriſt united with the Church, by the name of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. we muſt therefore help on the perfection of this latter, ſeeing he is already perfect in the former.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an muſt be a King.</note> To this purpoſe every man muſt become a <hi>King</hi> (for ſo he is if hee partake of Chriſts anointing) in being ever in the field in combate againſt ſin, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up arms againſt Satans helliſh power, in getting daily dominion over his own rebellious fleſh, and wicked luſts. For if thou beeſt a Chriſtian, thou haſt ten thouſand rebels to encounter, and as many ſtrong temptations and luſts which thou muſt ſtand out to victory: and here faith muſt be thy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which grace is attained by this anointing.

                        <note place="margin">And a Prieſt, Rom. 6 13</note> Again, thou that wilt be a Chriſtian, muſt be a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> to offer <hi>up thy ſelf,</hi> ſoul and body, an acceptable <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of ſweet ſmell unto the Lord: to offer up thy prayers and praiſes, the <hi>calves of thy lips:</hi> theſe are the <hi>odours</hi> of the Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.8. to offer up thy <hi>ſins</hi> to bee <hi>ſacrificed</hi> and ſlain by the knife and ſword of the Spirit in the Miniſtery of the word: to offer the ſacrifices of almes and mercy, with which <hi>ſacrifices God is well pleaſed:</hi> to offer the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a <hi>broken and contrite heart,</hi> which the Lord deſpiſeth not: and laſtly, to offer, if need require, thy life, and deereſt bloud for Chriſt and his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     <q>Who went about doing good,</q>
                     <p>Now we come to Chriſts execution of his Office, according to his former calling and furniſhing. For no ſooner receiveth he gifts and calling from his Father, but he manifeſteth and putteth forth the ſame in moſt painful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and moſt powerful working of Miracles; which hee did not for a brunt, or by ſtarts, and fits, but he <hi>went aboue</hi> doing good. By which words is noted his diligence, in abſolving and finiſhing his courſe within his vocation and calling: not ſeeking herein himſelf, nor the praiſe or applauſe of men, nor the Kingdoms of this world, but denying himſelf and glory, ſpent his whole life in doing <hi>good</hi> unto others; ſuffering himſelf to bee ſubdued under a moſt ſhameful and curſed death; that hee might bring others to life, who were as yet his enemies, and lying in the ſhadow of death.</p>
                     <p>Wherein he propounded himſelf a worthy pattern and example of imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto all ſuch as have received gifts,
<note place="margin">Note.</note> and calling unto any office in Church or Common-wealth: who are not to hide in a Napkin thoſe talents, but bring them forth, and traffick with them: and that not for their private, as ſeeking themſelves; but for the common good: and not for a ſtart or brunt, but thus to finiſh their courſe, holding out in well-doing unto the end.</p>
                     <p>Thus if we ſhall doe, we ſhall be conformable unto Jeſus Chriſt, acceptable to God our Father, profitable to our brethren here on earth, and ſhall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to our ſelves an excellent weight of glory in heaven. But how many bee there, who having received many talents, and charge to traffick with them, bury their gifts, and forget their charge; againſt whom the fearful ſentence is not only paſſed, but half executed already? his talent is taken from the ſloathful ſervant; there now remaineth nothing but the binding of him, and caſting him into hell. And would this were not too true, not in many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters only, but even in numbers of private Chriſtians, who have had both gifts and calling to teach and pray in their families, but have wilfully loſt them for want of the careful uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>Now more ſpecially, this going about of Chriſt doing good, ſtandeth in two things. The former, in curing the deadly diſeaſes of mens ſouls, by moſt holy and ſaving doctrin, revealing his Fathers whole will, and teaching the things of the Kingdom, not coldly, as the Scribes, but in moſt powerful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: ſo as his very enemies were forced to ſay, <hi>Never man ſpake as this man doth.</hi> The latter, in curing the bodies of men alſo by moſt powerful Miracles: one kind whereof, which was moſt eminent (namely the healing of Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaks) is put for all the reſt, in the words following: by both which means he ſhewed himſelf a merciful Saviour, and the chief Phyſician both of ſoul and body, and in one word, the very healing God.</p>
                     <p>Of both which points we are to ſpeak ſomething, ſeeing the former is the principal, and included in this latter; and theſe latter were but ſervants unto the former. It is true that the Jews were more affected with his Miracles than with his Doctrin, inſomuch as they were often wholly carried after him for the bread and belly ſake. Which ſeemeth to bee the reaſon why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh more plainly of theſe, as being better obſerved, and more ſparingly of his Doctrin, which was not ſo great a rayſer of his fame as theſe were: but it muſt not bee ſo with us, who look for Salvation by his moſt holy Doctrin, but cannot by his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:40284:163"/>
                     <p>And firſt for his <hi>Doctrin;</hi> the calling of our bleſſed Saviour being to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt,
<note place="margin">Chriſt went about doing good in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing every where moſt holy doctrin.</note> to reduce the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto the fold, to finde the loſt groat, to call ſinners unto Repentance; how all his life was thus taken up, were too long in every particular to manifeſt. To omit his private life which was nothing but an increaſing in wiſdome and favour with God and man. After his ſolemn and publike inaugurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee ſhewed himſelf a perfect mirrour of goodneſs, both in the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of his prophetical office, as alſo in the more ſpecial practices of it.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>former,</hi> how faithful was hee in all the houſe of his Father; not as <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was but a Servant, but <hi>as the Son;</hi> who from the boſome of his Father brought and delivered a moſt perfect Word of Truth; yea, who was not only the bearer of it, but the very Author of all Truth? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to his Power and Commiſſion, reformed the Law corrupted with falſe gloſſes of the Phariſees, and eſtabliſhed it: preached the Goſpel, and diſperſed it, by himſelf, his Apoſtles, and other <hi>Teachers</hi> after them raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by himſelf; and fitted with gifts thereunto for the gathering of the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. inſtituted, and miniſtred the Sacraments of the New Teſtament after the aboliſhing of the Old: framed and preſcribed a perfect form of prayer, unto which all ours muſt bee ſquared: delivered (as <hi>Moſes</hi>) a pattern of the Temple and all things therein; namely, an abſolute form of external govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the perpetual uſe of the Church, for the well ordering and cutting off diſ-orders in it.</p>
                     <p>And for the <hi>later,</hi> how careful was hee to take all occaſions to inſtruct par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons in the will of his Father; nay, not onely to <hi>take,</hi> but even <hi>ſeek</hi> them, that ſo hee might make offer of the greateſt good, that ever men in this world could meet withall? If his Diſciples onely ſpeak of bread, hee telleth them hee hath other bread that they know not of. If a poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man meet him while ſhee goeth to draw a bucket of water, hee preacheth unto her of the water of the well of life. If hee look upon the Sun, hee takes occaſion thence to inſtruct thoſe who were about him, that he is the light of the world, and that whoſoever follow him, walk not in darkneſs. If he ſee but a little child, hee thence taketh occaſion to inſtruct his followers in the Doctrin of humility, innocency, and meekneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. If hee do but hear of his Mother and Brethren, hee taketh occaſion to ſhew his ſpiritual kindred, and acquaintance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.50. And in <hi>both theſe,</hi> how Meekly, gently, humbly, yea, and compaſſionately did he carry himſelf towards thoſe that were any way teachable, howſoever in publike, and againſt gain-ſayers hee taught with Majeſty, and as one having authority? Beſides this, how boldly and diligently went hee about, Preaching the will of his Father in the midſt of dangers, diſcouragements, and reproaches, which were raiſed againſt him: not onely when they lay in wait to catch him in his ſpeech, but even to attach his perſon to miſchief him? How often did the Jews take up ſtones to ſtone him? <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. &amp; 10. How did the people aſſault him to throw him down head-long from the top of an hill? <hi>Luke</hi> 4.29. how many other deadly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers eſcaped hee, and yet in the midſt of death could not bee diſcouraged, nor overcome of their malice, but overcame their evil with goodneſs?</p>
                     <p>Unto which moſt holy courſe of Doctrin, if wee adde his moſt innocent life, in which was no ſpot or error, it addeth alſo grace and glory to his Doctrin. Never went any before him, or can do after him, doing good as hee did: for hee never did otherwiſe; no word or deed ever proceeded from him, but was anſwerable to the Laws perfection: ſo as the Church may well ſing out his beauty from top to toe which is every way matchleſs and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,

<note place="margin">Joh. 3.2</note> that no man <hi>could do ſuch things unleſs God were with him:</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.14. Then the men when they <hi>had ſeen the miracle,</hi> ſaid, <hi>This is of a truth the Prophet that ſhould come into the World.</hi> Thirdly, to confirm the truth of his Doctrin, and conſequently our Faith in the ſame; Joh. 11.14.

                     </p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But the Prophets and Apoſtles alſo wrought miracles, and therefore they cannot argue him more extraordinary, either for his perſon, or office, than they were.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, becauſe there was great difference between his Miracles,
<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Chriſt, and of the Prophets and Apoſtles.</note> and thoſe that were wrought by Prophets and Apoſtles. For howſoever all of them conſpired in the main end of them, which was to confirm the ſame Doctrin, together with the Divine perſon, and office of Jeſus Chriſt: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the ſubſtance of them, all of them in both being ſuch works as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the power, reach, and law of all nature created, yet differ they much,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>In the manner of working:</hi> Chriſt wrought his Miracles by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſtrength, Luke 6.19. <hi>The whole multitude ſought to touch him, for</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue went out of him, <hi>and hee healed them all.</hi> But they wrought by Chriſts power, and acknowledging themſelves but Inſtruments, diſclaim all power in themſelves, that all the glory might bee Chriſts, whoſe alſo the works done in and by them are: Act. 3.12. <hi>Why ſtand yee gazing on us, as if wee by our own power or godlineſſe had made this man go? The God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>hath glorified his Son Jeſus, —and his name hath made this man ſound,</hi> verſ. 16. Yea, in the working they ſhew themſelves inſtruments: As, <hi>Moſes</hi> commandeth the Sea, but he is bidden take his ſtaffe: <hi>Elizeus</hi> divideth <hi>Jordan,</hi> but hee muſt uſe his cloak, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> divideth <hi>Jordan,</hi> but by means of the Ark, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3.13. but when Chriſt commeth to ſtill the Sea, hee doth it by his very word, and command, which is ſo powerful, as the very ſenceleſs creatures obey it. So alſo the Apoſtles in working miracles, alwaies change their ſtile from Chriſts. Act. 3.6. <hi>In the name of Jeſus Chriſt I ſay to thee, riſe and walk:</hi> Act. 9.34. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Aeneas, Jeſus Chriſt maketh thee whole, ariſe.</hi> But Chriſt comming to a ſick perſon, ſaith, Mar. 5.41. <hi>Maid, I ſay to thee ariſe:</hi> yea, to a dead man, as to <hi>Lazarus, I ſay to thee ariſe.</hi> So the Apoſtles in caſting our Devils, commanded them in the name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to come out,</hi> Act. 16.12. But Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Come out of the man thou unclean ſpirit,</hi> charging them in his own name.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Prophets and Apoſtles had not that habitual power to work miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, when they would, nor could not at any time, but even then when they were commanded by the Spirit. But Chriſt could when hee pleaſed, not being at the command of any other; but having ever that power with him which could command whole nature: ſo as Chriſt onely went about doing good by his own power and word, and no Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> or Apoſtle could ſo do it; and this power was habitual in him, which in them was preſent onely in ſome extraordinary motion.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But was not the holy Doctrin of Chriſt ſufficient and powerful enough of it ſelf without miracles?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> His Doctrin was ſuch as ought to have been received for it ſelf, if
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40284:164"/> there had been no addition of miracles, which onely ſerve to help our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe incredulity is ſuch, as except wee ſee <hi>ſignes and wonders, wee will not beleeve,</hi> Joh. 4.48. whereas wee muſt ſtrive to ſay with the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that wee beleeve <hi>not now</hi> for the Miracle, but becauſe our <hi>ſelves have heard</hi> him, ver. 42.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But how can thoſe Miracles infallibly confirm his Dostrin or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſeeing it is granted to wicked men alſo to work Miracles? as</hi> Pharaohs <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters,</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>the Man of Sin: yea, one may remove Mountains who wanteth love: and many ſhall ſay in the day of judgement, Lord, wee have caſt out Devils</hi> in thy name, <hi>and done</hi> many great things, <hi>to whom hee ſhall anſwer, Depart from mee, I never knew you.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, in their ſubſtance or being: for in a true Miracle, the thing is the ſame that it appeareth to bee, and hath true and real, and not onely ſeeming effects. <hi>Moſes</hi> produced a true Serpent, and very blood; whoſe effects were the eating up of the Enchanters rods, and the killing of the fiſh: but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are lies, and not the things which they ſeem to bee, called by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>lying Wonders;</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. meer Sorceries, Juglings, Sleights, deluding the ſences; in ſtead of <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelf, offering but a ſhape or appearance of him to <hi>Saul.</hi> Thus <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Inchanters by jugling, made no Serpent, nor blood, but the appearance of both: for the Text ſaith expreſly, it was done by <hi>Sorcery, Exod.</hi> 7.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.7. Such lying wonders are the Popiſh Miracles, the ſweating of their Images, the bleeding of ſome of their hoſts, the motions of their Images, their ſpeech, their weeping; moſt of them effected by ſleight and knavery; and many other by ſorcery and jugling.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But was not that a true and real effect of the Devil, when hee ſtirred up winds, and blow down</hi> Jobs <hi>houſe, and ſlew his children?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, but no true Miracle, becauſe it was done mediately by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes, for hee knoweth well the matter of windes, and the manner of generating them, and by Gods permiſſion can gather much matter together, and joyn himſelf with it, to make it far more violent, raging, and fitting to his purpoſe than ordinary; but all this while exceedeth hee not the compaſs of nature, which all true Miracles do. The like muſt bee ſaid of the fire which he brought down from Heaven upon the Cattel and ſervants of <hi>Job,</hi> hee crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it not, for creation is the ſole and proper action of God; but added com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matter together,
<note place="margin">Vel ludificatio ſenſus, vel oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultatum natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralium cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum conjunctio</note> and brought fire to it, by his power and agility. And thus alſo he infected the air, corrupted <hi>Jobs</hi> humors, and ſmote him with ſore boyles from top to toe. In one word, all the work of Satan, and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſuch ſtrange events, is nothing elſe, but either, the deceiving of the ſenſes, or conjunction of natural cauſes to deceive by. And by the way, let the <hi>Romane</hi> Church conſider what kind of Miracle their tranſubſtantiation is; ſeeing in every true miracle, every thing is as it appeareth to be; and there is no appearance but of bread.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>In the end and uſe:</hi> true Miracles alwaies confirm true doctrin, alwaies tend to the glory of God, and ſalvation of men; but all theſe falſe Miracles, as they bee lies, ſo they tend to lies, to confirm falſe Doctrin, to impair Gods Glory, to hinder the Salvation of men, yea, to further and haſten their Damnation. The Miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> tended to the diſ-miſſing of Gods People, according to Gods Commandement, that himſelf might bee ſerved, his people eaſed, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf (if it might bee) freed from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: but the lying wonders of <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> (for they were the Sorcerers that reſiſted <hi>Moſes</hi>) tended to hold them in <hi>Egypt</hi> ſtill, againſt the expreſs Commandement of God; to harden the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40284:164"/> the power and glory of God, and the good of his people, yea, of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf and his land. By which rule if wee ſhall examine Popiſh Miracles, wee ſhall ever finde them brought to confirm ſome untruth, which hath no ground in the word to ſtand upon; as to prove Image-worſhip, prayers to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Saints, Angels, and dead men; Pilgrimages, Monaſtical life, with ſundry other orders, Chriſts real and bodily preſence in the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hoſt, the verity of their moſt Idolatrous Maſſe. To which or the like purpoſes let them bring in their whole legend; we are to adjudge their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle-mongers no better than <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Inchanters; nor the Miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no other than the lying Wonders of Antichriſt, which cauſe men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve lyes, who have not received the love of the truth.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>they differ in the manner of confirming doctrin.</hi> For never was any device ſo powerfully confirmed, as the Doctrin and Religion of Chriſt which we profeſs. For as it is ſaid of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Inchanters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.17. after that <hi>Moſes</hi> had brought the Lice, that they aſſayed to doe the like, but could not; ſo in admirable wiſdome hath the Lord put forth his mighty power, in effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſuch Miracles for this doctrin, as he never ſuffered to bee wrought for any other. For this only hath he ſtayed and pulled back the courſe of the Sun in the Heavens; letted the fire from burning; divided the Sea, and made it ſtand as a wall; raiſed not the ſick only to health, but the dead to life: ſtrengthned decrepit perſons to beget and conceive; yea more, ſet apart a Virgin to bear a Son.</p>
                     <p>Let Popiſh impoſtors leave to bragge of Straw-miracles, ſuch as was taken up at <hi>Garnets</hi> execution; and their childiſh Miracles, as their late <hi>London</hi> Boy; and ſhew us ſuch as theſe. Let us hear (but without impoſture) of ſuch as ſpeak with new tongues; drive away Serpents, and drink deadly poyſon and hurt them not; but never was any other doctrin thus confirmed: and whatſoever Signs and Wonders are wrought to weaken any part of this truth, or eſtabliſh any doctrin not grounded therein, as we are commanded, ſo wee hold them all accurſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. In that Chriſt went about doing good, we note,
<note place="margin">Chriſts life was not monaſtical, but he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with men to doe good unto them.</note> that as his perſon was a perfect mirrour of all goodneſſe; ſo <hi>his life was no monaſtical or cloyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red life:</hi> but his delight was with the ſons of men, hee eat with them, drunk with them, more familiarly converſed with them than <hi>John</hi> did, that hee might ſtill take occaſion to doe them good, and communicate unto them of his fulneſſe of grace. Neither was his life an idle, delicate, or pompous life, neither ſwelled he with abundance and wealth: but poor, mean, induſtrious, and painful: he continually went about doing good. From whom how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miniſters are degenerate; who profeſſing themſelves ſervants, would bee loath to be as their Lord was? ſome ſetting up themſelves as it were a fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a courſe of caſe and delicacy: <hi>feeding themſelves</hi> (not the flock) <hi>without fear;</hi> others climbing with reſtleſs deſires to honours and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: others inceſſantly thirſting (as if they had a Dropſie) after mony and profits, ſerving their Maſter only to carry the bagge: others are doing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, but little good they doe in their places, their doctrin is ſo cold, ſo indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, or their lives ſo ſcandalous, ſo offenſive; or their hearts ſo corrupt and cankred, as they rather oppoſe themſelves to the doing or doers of good; amongſt all whom, the Maſter is out of ſight, and out of mind.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Seeing Chriſt by this going about and doing good, ſhewed himſelf to be that Prophet, whom God would raiſe like <hi>Moſes, mighty in word and deed:</hi> Deut. 18.15. We are hence bound to beleeve him, and his holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſo ſurely confirmed by ſo many and mighty Miracles; that ſo wee may avoid that fearful hardning ſo long before Prophecied to befall the Jews, <hi>Who though he had done many Miracles before them,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Read <hi>John</hi> 11.37, 38.</note> 
                        <hi>yet beleeved not they on him:</hi> and attain alſo the bleſſedneſſe of thoſe that beleeve, without deſiring to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:40284:165"/> ſee any more new Miracles. For is not the doctrin wee profeſſe ſufficiently confirmed already?
<note place="margin">The ancient doctrin of the Church need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it.</note> an Indenture once ſealed, is confirmed for ever, and needeth no new ſeals to be ſet to it. Men doe not ever water their plants, but only till they be rooted: even ſo the Lord out of his wiſdome would water with Miracles the tender plant of his Church, till it was rooted in the world, and brought on to ſome ſtrength and ſtature; but afterward thought all ſuch labour needneſſe. If men will broach and bring into the Church new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins, and deviſes of their own (as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church doth at this day) it is no marvail it they ſeek after new Miracles to obtrude them withall: but if men will profeſſe the ancient doctrin of the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelf, to gape after new Miracles, were too lightly to eſteem of the old; and account of theſe powerful works of Chriſt himſelf and his ſervants no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſome nine days wonders.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, who would think him poſſeſſed that can fall down on his knees, make a ſolemn profeſſion and confeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, that he is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and the <hi>moſt high,</hi> Mark 5.7. and make loud prayers unto him, as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him to be the Lord of glory? and yet all theſe are the ſpeeches and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours of a man poſſeſſed, not with one or two, but with a Legion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.28. What, doe the Devils honour Chriſt, who fear nothing more than that he ſhould be honoured, and hate nothing ſo much as he? No, but all this confeſſion and worſhip was by conſtraint; partly, becauſe they knew him a Prince and a Judge, whoſe power they could not reſiſt: and partly they flatter him, to obtain more gentle entreaty at his hands than they deſerved: ſo many a man profeſſeth Chriſt, but you ſhall obſerve, at leaſt he may himſelf, that many foul ſpirits breath in him: for although hee know Chriſt (as the Devils did) yet he obeyeth him not; he would fain reſiſt him if he were ſtrong enough to make his part good againſt him: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot doe, he will give him fair words, and call him Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: he will pray to him in ſickneſs or diſtreſs, but it is but to get out of his hands, and keep his wonted hold ſtill.</p>
                     <p>If the power of Chriſts word come near him, he can begin to accuſe Chriſt, and Chriſtian profeſſion of unpeaceableneſs, and tormenting him before the time (for what time would pleaſe theſe that Chriſt ſhould come unto them?) he can ask Chriſt and his Miniſters what they have to doe with him, and Chriſt ſhall be blamed, becauſe he cannot be at peace for him, if he would let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, all ſhould be well and quiet, but the Miniſtery and Diſcipline are intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: let Chriſt preach, and he will preach him too, ſo it be ſuch a Goſpel as bringeth no repentance or amendment of life to himſelf, but he may remain where he was, even in the Graves, already lodged with death. When hee cannot doe the greater miſchief that he would, he would doe the leſſer if hee can: if he cannot hinder the Miniſtery, he can deprave it: wherein (as in all the reſt) he ſhews himſelf at the command of that wicked ſpirit, who when he could no longer torment the man, would drown the ſwine.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, although the Devil might be forced through the power of Chriſt to acknowledge him the holy one of God, ſo as themſelves might continue Devils ſtill; yet who would think him guided by any other than a good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, that ſhould extol the ſervants of Chriſt, their perſons, their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, their doctrin? for would any conceive that the Father of Lyes would praiſe the truth? and yet mark what a large teſtimony the Devil himſelf in the Maid gave of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Theſe men are the ſervants of the moſt high God, which ſhew unto us the way of ſalvation: and this ſhe did many days,</hi> A ts 16.17. Why, did not the Devil know that they were the greateſt enemies he had upon earth? Yes, he did, but he muſt ſometimes transform himſelf into an Angel of Light, he muſt colour all his Lyes with ſome truth which is undeniable, hee can lay all his falſhoods upon appearance of truth; as his eldeſt Son <hi>Mahomet</hi> enlarged the praiſes of Chriſt, and his Diſciples, to overthrow Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion withall: he hath his fetch to make men beleeve there is an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and himſelf, or that they needed his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; who therefore put him to ſilence, and would receive no commendation from him, but for praiſes returned ſharp rebukes. Even ſo, many men can praiſe good men and Miniſters before their faces, whom they know to bee deadly enemies to their vices: not for love of their vertues, but leſt they ſhould uſe them: and can call them honeſt men, to try if by that they can hinder them from doing the duty of honeſt men, as the Devils called <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> the Servants of God, leſt they ſhould ſhew themſelves ſo by diſpoſſeſſing them.</p>

                     <p>Beſides, they would ſeem herein to bee better than they are, and therefore will honour the Goſpel, and bringers, with their mouths, whereas in their hearts they cannot abide that the doctrin of it ſhould bee in ſincerity, either publiſhed or practiſed: the name of Chriſtianity and of the Goſpel pleaſeth them well enough, ſo as the power and fruit of it come not neer them. But as the Devil had no ſooner praiſed the Servants of God, but preſently hee changed his coppy, and never left perſecuting them till hee had caſt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon, got them <hi>ſoundly beaten,</hi> ſet faſt <hi>in the ſtocks,</hi> and after ſent out of the <hi>City:</hi> even ſo, many who now commend the perſon and doctrin of the Servants of God, preſently (ſhewing what ſpirit guideth them) can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them to bee mutinous, and ſeditious, troublers of their City and State; and raiſe up the whole City, and ſtir up the wrath of the Magiſtrates againſt them, that ſo under pretence of the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Who would think that hee could be haunted with a wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that can ſee his ſin, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17, 18. confeſs it with tears and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt himſelf, openly juſtify the righteouſneſs of Gods children? and yet in the example of <hi>Saul</hi> wee ſee that a ſoul poſſeſſed of Satan may do all this. For as it is in bodily poſſeſſion, though the Devils deſire is inceſſantly to hurt and vex the poor creatures, yet by Gods over-ruling power hee is forced to give them ſome reſpite, and though <hi>hardly,</hi> yet ſometimes <hi>departeth from them;</hi> and not alwaies, but <hi>ſometimes</hi> caſts them into the fire, and <hi>ſometimes</hi> into the water, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. So is it in ſpiritual poſſeſſion, the Lord for the common good bridleth often the rage of the Devil in his inſtruments, that they cannot alwaies exerciſe it as they would; but they have their fits ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that is, ſome ſtrong luſts which Satan watcheth and putteth himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (as <hi>Judas</hi> his Covetouſneſs invited the Devil to enter into him) and alſo ſometimes again they have their good moods, and ſeem to bee come to themſelves; but long ſtay they not here, but in a moment are changed and caſt into their fits again.</p>
                     <p>Thus in a good mood, <hi>Saul</hi> could confeſs his wickedneſs, and <hi>Davids</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and lift up his voice and weep; and <hi>David</hi> was now his good Son, and who but hee? but preſently the <hi>good ſpirit went,</hi> and the <hi>evil spirit came upon him,</hi> and hee became more tyrannous and furious than ever before: even ſo ſome there are who ſeem to have remorſe of conſcience for ſin, they will confeſs their wickedneſs with tears, pray for pardon, promiſe amendment, beg prayers of others (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) one would think them very penitent, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves think they are ſo alſo, but the Moon changeth not ſo often as theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual lunaticks: who hence may know that the evil ſpirit hath taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them, becauſe they are never long in a good minde. Theſe few notes, inſtead of many, I thought good to ſet down, to help men that are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſee how ſecretly Satan worketh in their ſouls; and how hee can cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly moſt forceably keep poſſeſſion, when hee ſeemeth moſt to diſclaim it: that thus they comming to perceive the diſeaſe, may run out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſeek for remedy. Which what it is, wee are now in the next point to declare.</p>
                     <p>The third point in the words to bee conſidered is, <hi>The mighty power of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ, who onely could heal thoſe that were thus oppreſſed and enthralled by the Devil:</hi> and here conſider, 1 The <hi>ground;</hi> 2 The <hi>proof or manifeſtation</hi> of it.

By his very word hee chained and bound them whom no bolts could hold, nor any other means ſubdue: ſuch was his power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (though men ſaw little of it) that the Devils could neither fly from him, nor yet abide his preſence.

                     <p>That the Apoſtles were ſuch witneſſes of all things which Chriſt did, and ſuffered in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> will appear to him that conſidereth, that it was one of Chriſts firſt actions in his Offices, after his Baptiſm, to call his Diſciples, who preſently left all and followed him, to the end that they might be oculate witneſſes, of his mighty works, of his life, of his death and reſurrection: and that they may be ear-witneſſes, of all the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth: to which purpoſe, he took them after a ſort into his Family, that by their domeſtical and familiar converſe with him, all the while he lived in the execution of his office, they might be furniſhed to this teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>Hence is it that <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>We ſaw his glory,</hi> namely in his Doctrin and Works: and, the things which we have <hi>heard and ſeen, declare wee unto you.</hi> Many worthy points concerning this <hi>witneſſe</hi> of the Apoſtles, were here to be delivered, but that I referre them all to the forty one, and forty two verſes, where we ſhall as fitly, and more fully handle the ſame.

Secondly, although he had no perſonal ſin to bring him to death, yet had he ſin imputed unto him, even the ſins of his whole Church, which he willingly took upon himſelf; ſo as God reckoned with him, not for the ſins of one man, but of all his Church, and eſteemed him as a captain ſinner till the price was paid; and men reckoned him among ſinners, and eſteemed him an arch-malefactor.</p>

<note place="margin">The malice of the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is never without matter to work upon.</note> 
                        <hi>what an imbred malice there is in wicked men againſt Chriſt, and his Members;</hi> for it is never without matter to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it cannot accuſe juſtly of evil, it can unjuſtly condemn for doing good: this Chriſt ſheweth, Joh. 10.32. <hi>Many good works have I done, for which of them do yee ſtone mee?</hi> They anſwer him no, but they ſtone him for Blaſphemy: ſo ſomething ſhall bee pretended, as Blaſphemy, Treaſon, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, faction, or ſome ſuch thing, and a form of Law ſhall bee followed; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world is more eaſy than to finde out a Law to put Chriſt to death by (for that is the concluſion of all wicked Laws, Chriſt and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers muſt dye by them) but whatſoever bee pretended againſt them, it maketh much for the glory of God, the patience of his Saints, and the juſt overthrow of his enemies, that whatſoever the godly ſuffer at the hands of the wicked, it is for moſt part, cauſles in themſelves, and conſequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in the other. Let ſuch as profeſſe the Lord Jeſus, take notice hereof, and content themſelves, if they finde return of evil for good; it was their Lords caſe, and the ſervant can look for no better entertainment than his Lord findeth.</p>
                     <p>Let us not bee weary of well-doing, although it breed us hatred of the World, as knowing, that the ſame ſpirit of malice is gone out into the world, and doth breath in numbers that follow the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> who ſlew his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe his works were good; as all thoſe titles of reproach caſt upon Gods Children lowdly convince, as that they are Church-gadders, holy Brethren, too nice and preciſe perſons; the which and the like tearms, if a man ſing but a Pſalm in his Family, hee cannot avoid: well, needs muſt Chriſtians ſuffer, let their care bee to ſuffer onely as Chriſtians, and for well-doing: for it is no <hi>ſhame to ſuffer as a Chriſtian,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.17. and ſeeing it is the will of God that they muſt ſuffer, it is better (ſaith the Apoſtle) to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for <hi>well-doing</hi> than as <hi>evil doers,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.16. many receiving indignities from men, will ſay, if I had deſerved ſuch and ſuch things, it would never have grieved mee, but Chriſtians muſt be in a contrary note, it would grieve mee if I had deſerved ſuch things as I ſuffer at the hands of men, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in that I have not deſerved them.</p>

As</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> This was the counſel of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. for the Jews did nothing againſt him, but by the <hi>determinate counſel, and fore-knowledge of God;</hi> which Counſel of God, over-ruled the matter, and brought it to this paſs ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:40284:173"/> for the High Prieſts had accuſed Chriſt with blaſphemy, had produced witneſſes againſt him in that cauſe, yea, had his own confeſſion, that hee was the Son of God, which they took for blaſphemy: yet for this could they not put him to this kinde of death, ſeeing the blaſphemer, by the Law of God, muſt bee ſtoned, not crucified, and ſo had Chriſt been, if the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death had been in the hands of the Jews, as not long before it was: but the providence of God over-ruleth the matter ſo, as hee muſt bee brought before the <hi>Romane</hi> Governour, and a new action of treaſonable affecting the Kingdome bee laid againſt him, whence it was that <hi>Pilate</hi> asked if hee were the King of the <hi>Jewe,</hi> and hee anſwered, yea, upon which anſwer, hee was condemned to the moſt cruel death that was in uſe among the <hi>Romanes:</hi> for of thoſe three kindes of death, burning, heading, and crucifying, this laſt was the moſt ſevere and ſhameful,
<note place="margin">Chriſt reputed an arch-Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in his life and death.</note> to which the chief malefactors were ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: and that Chriſt was executed as an Arch-traytor, the inſcription on the Croſs, containing the crime for which he was condemned, plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Jeſus of</hi> Nazaret <hi>the King of the Jews,</hi> that no man could look upon or read that writing, but hee ſhould preſently conceive Chriſt a malefactor in the higheſt kind of treaſon and rebellion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This kinde of death was anciently prefigured, as alſo fore-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied: it was prefigured by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> laid bound upon the wood, and the other ſacrifices, which all were laid on the wood to bee conſumed by fire; by the lifting up of the ſhoulder of the peace offering, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.30. by the ſhaking of the breaſt of the ſame to and fro, which as ſome ſay, ſignifieth the ſpreading of our Saviours hands upon the Croſs: but eſpecially by the lifting up of the braſen ſerpent in the wilderneſſe, which, (as Chriſt ſaith) ſhadowed his own lifting up upon the croſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14.</p>
                     <p>Again, this kind of death was alſo fore-propheſied, Pſal. 22.16. <hi>they peirced or digged my hands and feet:</hi> it was alſo foretold by himſelf, Mat. 20.19. <hi>They ſhall deliver him to the Gentiles, and they ſhall mock him, and ſcourge him, and crucify him:</hi> and that it was neceſſary that this word of Chriſt ſhould bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.32.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This kinde of death carried with it a more ſpecial infamy than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other (as at this day wee count hanging a dogs death, that is, an infamous kinde of death) becauſe it was eſpecially execrable by the Law, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed every one which was hanged on a tree; not that this death by any Law of nature, or in it ſelf, was more accurſed than burning, or preſſing, nor by the Sword; for then neither the Thief on the Croſs could bee ſaved, nor any of our fellons thus executed, whereas the ſcripture in the one, and our own experience in the other, ſpeak the contrary: but it was onely accurſed by the Ceremonial law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo that every Malefactor of the Jews that was hanged, was in the Ceremony accurſed, and was the type of Chriſt, the ſubſtance of all Ceremonies, who on the Croſs was really and truely accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſuſtaining the whole wrath of God, which is the curſe of the Law, and not onely Ceremonially and typically as they were. This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. that Chriſt was not onely dead, but <hi>made a curſe for us:</hi> his reaſon is, becauſe <hi>hee dyed on a tree;</hi> and therefore are wee admoniſhed. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. to conſider, not only that Chriſt <hi>was obedient unto the death,</hi> but to the death of the <hi>Croſs:</hi> for any other death had not ſo much concerned us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This death which ſo much concerned all the Church of the Jews, and Gentiles, muſt not bee obſcure, and therefore the Lord would not have Chriſt to dye in a tumult, or in ſecret, but moſt conſpicuouſly and apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the great City of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but tributary to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as it were upon the Theatre of the World, at a ſolemn feaſt, when all the Males out of all quarters muſt appear before the Lord: upon a Croſs high erected, that all might ſee him, and on the Croſs himſelf proclaimed King of the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:40284:173"/> Jewes, in three ſeveral Langages, the Latine, Greek, and Hebrew, that all ſorts of men might come to the knowledge of it: and further, becauſe in his death ſtandeth our life, hee muſt bee thus lifted up that all men might ſee him certainly dead, and that he dyed not in ſhew and appearance only, but in deed, and in truth, really and perfectly: for which cauſe alſo our Apoſtle doubleth his affirmation, they <hi>ſlew him, and hanged him on a tree:</hi> which moſt neceſſary ground of Faith and Religion, Satan hath mightily by many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſought to overthrow: the Turks at this day are held off from the faith in this Meſſiah, by that Diabolical ſuggeſtion, that not Chriſt himſelf, but <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian</hi> was miraculouſly crucified in his ſtead.</p>
                     <p>And therefore becauſe the aſſurance of the death it ſelf aſſureth us more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all the fruits and benefits of it, the Scripture is careful ſo pregnantly to confirm it, as that it cannot be denied, not only that he was in the ſight of a number of thouſands dead on the Croſſe, but by his three days burial, by the peircing of his ſide, out of which came water and bloud, by which was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the very Call of his heart was peirced, by the confeſſion of his very enemies, who would beleeve nothing but their own ſences: and laſtly, by the fact of the Souldiers, who, whereas they haſtened the death of the Theeves by breaking their leggs, they broke not his, becauſe (the text ſaith) they ſaw that he was dead already.</p>
                     <p>The fourth point is the uſe of Chriſts Crucifying. Firſt, in Chriſt on the Croſſe take a full view of the curſedneſſe and execration of ſin, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of thine own wretchedneſſe, both in regard of thy wicked nature, and curſed practices; every ſin being ſo loathſome and odious in the eyes of God, as the leaſt could never be put away but by ſuch an ignominious death of the Son of God himſelf.</p>
                     <p>If thou lookeſt at ſin in thy ſelf, or in thy ſufferings, yea or in the ſufferings of the damned in Hell, it will ſeem but a ſlight thing: but behold God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down from Heaven, and him that thought it no robbery to bee equal to his Father in glory, taking fleſh, in that fleſh abaſing himſelf to the death of the Croſſe, on that Croſſe ſuſtaining the whole wrath of his Father, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming accurſed for it, and thou ſhalt ſee it in the native face of it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this one conſideration ſetteth a more ugly face upon ſin, than the Law poſſibly can; for that ſheweth our ſins to bee a knife to ſtab our ſelves withall,
<note place="margin">The moſt ugly viſage of ſin that can be.</note> but this to be the very ſpear that went to Chriſts heart, which is the moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apprehenſion in the world: all the ſin that ever was committed on the earth, could not bring a man ſo low (ſuppoſe one man had committed them all) as the leaſt ſin of the elect brought the Son of God; ſeeing he that falleth loweſt, falleth but from one degree in earth to another, but Chriſt falleth from the glory of Heaven, into the very ſorrows of Hell: whoſoever thou art then that makeſt light account of ſin, and pleadeſt that God is merciful, look a little in this glaſſe, wherein behold Gods Juſtice, and ſins deſert, in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers juſt indignation againſt his wel-beloved Son, whom nothing but the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death of his only Son, in whom he profeſſed himſelf well pleaſed, could appeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſeeing all the knowledge of Chriſt profitable to ſalvation, is of Chriſt crucified, let us deſire to know nothing in compariſon, but <hi>Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2. ſeeing ſuch a great Apoſtle as <hi>Paul</hi> was, deſired to know nothing elſe. Now to come to the diſtinct knowledge of it, we muſt conſider theſe three points. 1 The vertue and power of this death in it ſelf. 2 The application of it unto our ſelves. 3 The fruits, which muſt appear in us by ſuch application.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, Look upon this death of the Son of God, not as of another dead man, neither think or ſpeak of it as of the death of another ordinary fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon executed; but as of a death which ſlew all the ſins, of all the beleevers in
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:40284:174"/> the world, and as a deſtroyer of all deſtroyers; a death wherein was more power than in all the lives of all Angels and Men that ever were or ſhall bee,
<note place="margin">More power in Chriſts death than in the lives of all men and Angels.</note> yea ſuch a death as hath life in it, quickning all the deaths of all that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by it. Here we have a mighty <hi>Sampſon</hi> bearing away the gates of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; by death, killing death; by ſuffering his Fathers wrath, overcoming it; by entring into the Grave, opening it for all beleevers; by his Bloud ſhedding upon the Croſſe, <hi>reconciling all things,</hi> Col. 1.20. never was there ſuch an active ſuffering of any man, which tormented and crucified the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils themſelves, when the Devils inſtruments were tormenting and crucifying him: it is peerleſſe and unmatchable, no Martyr ever thus ſuffered, though Popiſh doctrin would match as Corrivals ſome of their Saints ſufferings with it; the moſt faithful Martyrs ſuffered but diſſolution of ſoul and body; but Chriſt beſides, ſuffered the whole Wrath of God due to mans ſin: they ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in way of Chriſtian duty and ſervice; but he to make a ſacrifice of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin: they having their ſins removed, and taken off from them; but he <hi>bare</hi> all theirs, and all beleevers <hi>ſins in his body upon the tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore Humane wiſdom ſtumbleth at this death of Chriſt, yet muſt we, by the eye of faith, labour to eſpy glory in ignominy, eſteem of the Croſſe as an honourable Chariot, and rejoyce in a triumph made (as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſcoff) by an hanged man; thus ſhall we ſee the fooliſhneſs of God, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than man, and the weakneſs of God, ſtronger than man; thus alſo ſhall we imitate the holy men of God, who looking back to the Croſs of Chriſt, could ſee him thereon triumphing, ſpoyling Principalities, breaking down partitions, reconciling God and man, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.14. yea man and man, both Jew and Gentile, <hi>into one body upon his Croſſe,</hi> Epheſ. 2.15. ſlaying hatred, and procuring perfect peace.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſeeing it is clear in the text that Chriſt dyed not for his own ſins, it is clear that he dyed for the ſins of his elect, unto whom this vertue of his death muſt be applied; and this two waies, 1 To their Humiliation. 2 To their Conſolation.</p>
                     <p>Both of them grounded hereupon, that Chriſt was thus Crucified for thee: without which application, the knowledge of Chriſt crucified excelleth not that in the Devils themſelves. For the former, if Chriſt dyed for thee, then waſt thou the cauſe of his death, thou crucifyedſt him, thou art as faulty and blame-worthy for his death as ever was <hi>Judas, Pilate,</hi> the Jewes, or the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; thy ſins were the Nails, and the Spear, and thy ſelf waſt one of them that peirced him:

                        </gap>o the practice of repentance: Thus <hi>Peter,</hi> when he would bring down the ſtiffneſs of the Jews, told them, that they <hi>crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> Acts 2.37. which when they heard, they were <hi>pricked in their hearts, and ſaid, Men and brethren, what ſhall we doe to be ſaved?</hi> Popiſh
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40284:174"/> Preachers ſo handle this matter, as to ſtir up compaſſion towards Chriſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Jews, and <hi>Judas,</hi> and the Souldiers: but wee muſt labour by it to come to the hatred of our own ſins, or elſe wee ſhall come behind the Jewes themſelves.</p>
                     <p>For the latter, If Chriſt was thus crucified for thee, then alſo bee thou of good comfort, for many things were nailed on the Croſs with him, even all thy Inditement, all thy ſin, original and actual, the Curſe, Hell, and Death it ſelf dyed with him; if thou beeſt a beleever, the ſame nails which were driven into his hands and feet were driven into thy ſins, ſo as thou maiſt look upon the Croſs as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did upon the Brazen Serpent, and thereby be cured of all the ſting of ſin, and deadly ſickneſs of thy ſoul:
<note place="margin">Chriſt his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement is the advancement of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> thou maiſt behold his ignominy, as thy glorious robe; his arraignment, thy abſolution; his bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thy freedome; his abaſement, thy advancement; his nakedneſs, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of thy ſhame; his death, thy life; and his Fathers forſaking of him, an aſſurance that thou ſhalt never be forſaken.</p>
                     <p>Only this knowledge of Chriſt crucified in ſpecial for thee, is it that can ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Conſcience in peace: when thou knoweſt and beleeveſt that all thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and particular ſins were hung on the Croſs with Chriſt, and that hee in thy room ſuffered for them, that which in Gods acceptation was as much as if in thine own perſon thou hadſt borne the Curſe of the Law for all eternity. The moſt content themſelves generally to know that Chriſt dyed for Sinners, but never care to know what this particular application meaneth: The Popiſh doctrin alſo is an open adverſary to this moſt comfortable perſwaſion of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith: but it behooveth him that would have the right uſe of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, never to be at reſt, till he can come to ſay with the holy Apoſtle, <hi>who loved me,</hi> and <hi>gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. and with <hi>Thomas,</hi> after hee had ſeen the impreſſions of the Wounds in his hands and ſide, <hi>my Lord, and my God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſeeing that of the two main things in this death, 1 Merit. 2 The efficacy; <hi>none ſhall have his part in the former, that hath not in the latter:</hi> our care muſt be, if we would find life in this death of Chriſt, never to be at reſt until we find the fruit and effect thereof in ſome ſort in our ſelves. The moſt powerful fruits of it are reduced to two Heads, the former is an ingrafting of us into the ſimilitude of his death; for he dyed that we after a ſort ſhould dye with him. The latter is a framing in us the quality of his life; for therefore he dyed for us, that we ſhould live unto him: both of theſe are required to the right knowledge of Chriſt crucified; joyned, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. and enjoyned him that would know <hi>Chriſt as the truth is in Chriſt;</hi> called the caſting off of the old man, and the putting on of the new. What it is to bee planted into the ſimilitude of the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> the Apoſtle ſheweth; namely, when our <hi>old man is crucified with him,</hi> Rom. 6.6. but when is that done? the next words anſwer; when the <hi>body of ſin is deſtroyed:</hi> that is, not when ſin is reſtrained, or ſome ſins cut off; but when original ſin, that is, the old man is killed, in all the parts and members of ſin; when men hate, abhorre, and groan under their corruptions, yea even their ſmalleſt and ſweeteſt ſins: this is a fruit of Chriſts death, and noted to be in all thoſe that are Chriſts, when it is ſaid, that they crucifie the affections and luſts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how are theſe luſts crucified by the death of Chriſt?</hi>

For example, being tempted to impatiency in ſuſtaining wrongs, look upon Chriſt on the Croſs, what ſharp things he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the thorns, the nayls, the ſpear, and all this while as a ſheep dumb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſhearer: in motions to pride, look to Chriſt on the Croſs thus farre humbled for thy ſins: if to revenge, behold Chriſt on the Croſs praying, and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40284:175"/> dying for his deadly enemies: if to oppreſſe the poor and innocent, ſee Chriſt on the Croſſe ſuffering his bloud to be ſucked out for thoſe whoſe bloud thou ſuckeſt: ſo in temptation to any other ſin, deny it, and ſay, Oh no, I ſee Chriſt on the Croſſe made a curſe for my ſins already, I have done him wrong enough already, I will not adde this to the former, I ſee rather an infinite debt due from me towards him; and I muſt rather think of the payment of that, than offer to run in further.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee both the duty and the means, neither of them both are regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by many: ſome would fain ſee Chriſt on the Croſſe, for the remitting of their ſin, but not for the crucifying of it: their luſts are as ſtrong as ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before: pride, contention, haſtineſſe, voluptuouſneſſe, worldlineſſe, live and thrive in them, and yet they ſay, Chriſt was crucified for them, whereas if Chriſt be crucified for thee, the world is crucified unto thee, and thou unto the world. Others, becauſe Chriſt is come and dead for ſinners, make a clean contrary argument: Chriſt dyed for ſinners, and therefore they will live in their ſins: as though that were the work of Chriſt upon the Croſſe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſin, and Libertine courſes, and not rather to aboliſh the ſame: what a fearful thing is it that men dare make the death of the Son of God as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pack-horſe to lay all their ſins upon, while yet hereby they embolden themſelves in the multiplication of them?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Many will not endure to have their luſts pricked in the Miniſtery, and much leſſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</note> Others are ſo farre from crucifying their luſts, as they will not endure to have them prickt or touched in the Miniſtery: Oh meddle not with mine eyes, I can not endure it: or if they endure to crucifie many, yet ſome ſweet ſins ſhall be ſpared, they are ſweet morſels, or fat morſels, profitable or pleaſurable ſins, and they muſt not be let goe: but never a one of all theſe ever taſted in truth the leaſt fruit of the death of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond fruit that muſt appear in us, is the life <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.15. <hi>He dyed for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which dyed for them and roſe again:</hi> Rom. 6.11, 12. <hi>Likewiſe think yee alſo that yee are dead to ſin, but are alive to God in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> 12. <hi>Let not therefore ſin reign in your mortal body.</hi> In which places, this life of Chriſt is oppoſed to the courſe of our lives framed of our ſelves; and is nothing elſe but to depend upon Chriſt in all things, to give up all our thoughts, words, and actions to be guided by his word, and directed to his glory, and ſo to order our whole courſe, as his bleſſed Spirit may appear to breath, lead, and live in us. Now that this fruit ſhould be added to the former, is evident, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>He bare our ſins upon the tree, that we being dead to ſin, ſhould live in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus therefore help thy ſelf by this meditation, ſhall my Lord Jeſus ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly forſake his glory for me, and ſhall not I forſake my ſin and ſhame for him? ſhall he contentedly dye an accurſed death for me, and ſhall not I as contentedly dye to an accurſed life for him? Shall he dye to glorifie me; and ſhall not I live to glorifie him? Shall not he think his heart-bloud too dear for me, and ſhall I love any thing better than him? Thus to behold Chriſt on his Croſſe, will help thee forward in this fruit alſo.</p>

                     <p>And the words in general imply one point not to bee omitted: For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Apoſtle expreſſeth nothing between Chriſt his hanging on a tree, and his raiſing again; yet becauſe it cannot bee properly ſaid, that hee was raiſed from the Tree, or from the Croſs, which was a kinde of exaltation and lifting up, neceſſarily muſt bee included a lower eſtate than that was; namely, that condition of the dead under which hee lay for a certain time, as it were caſt from the face of God his Father, and of men, yea, from the face of the earth:
<note place="margin">Chriſt ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eſtate of death, why.</note> when death and ſin ſeemed to triumph over him all the while of his burial, when they had him in the grave, the houſe of death. This was the low eſtate from whence hee roſe, the which hee willingly ſubmitted himſelf unto for a time.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the faith of his Church might bee confirmed, in that hee was true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and certainly dead, and not in ſhew or appearance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That his victory and conqueſt over death might bee more glorious; in that hee could not hold him down when hee had him in his own houſe; but like a mighty <hi>Sampſon</hi> hee carried away the gates of his enemies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 To remove by undergoing for us that fearful ſtate of death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which we had otherwiſe for ever lain under; to ſanctify unto us our eſtate under temporal death, which is ſweetened by his death: to make our graves as ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">4 To teach us, that our head being of power to riſe from the power of death when the bands of it wrapped him round about; can now much more being in glory, draw us his members out of the deepeſt pits of danger or thraldome, ſpiritual or temporal; and will in his time ſet us free. This time wee muſt wait, but not appoint it; neither diſtruſt his power and grace when wee are in the deepeſt of our diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 That ſeeing it was his pleaſure to ſubmit himſelf to the loweſt eſtate of humiliation before his exaltation; wee might alſo with more cheerfulneſſe content our ſelves, to <hi>ſuffer</hi> even any abaſement <hi>with him,</hi> and for him, before wee look to reign with him.</p>
                     <p>The words of the verſe contain two things. 1 The aſſertion of Chriſt his reſurrection, <hi>Him God raiſed up the third day.</hi> 2 The manifeſtation or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, <hi>and cauſed that hee was openly ſhewed.</hi> The former part is laid down in four diſtinct points. 1 The perſon raiſed, <hi>him.</hi> 2 The perſon raiſing him, <hi>God.</hi> 3 The action it ſelf, <hi>raiſed,</hi> 4 The time when, <hi>the third day.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>It will bee demanded how Chriſt can bee ſaid to bee raiſed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How Chriſt can be ſaid to riſe, ſeeing neither his Deity nor the ſoul of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity aroſe.</note> 
                        <hi>ſeeing hee conſiſted of a Divine and a Humane nature whereof the firſt could neither fall nor riſe: and for the ſecond that alſo conſiſted of ſoul and body; the former of which being the principal part dyed not, but was in Paradiſe. Seeing then neither the Deity, nor the ſoul of his Humanity, nor his perſon did riſe, but only his body; how can Chriſt bee ſaid to bee raiſed?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In ſundry other places of Scripture beſides this, wee meet with ſuch ſynechdochical phraſes and forms of ſpeech, wherein ſomewhat is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:40284:176"/> to the whole, which is proper but to one part, and that aſcribed to the whole perſon, which belongeth but to one nature: which cometh to paſs by reaſon of that ſtraight and perſonal union of the two natures in Chriſt. Thus wee read that <hi>God purchaſed his Church by his own blood,</hi> Act. 20.28. and that the <hi>Lord of glory was crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. of the ſons being <hi>in heaven and in earth at one time,</hi> Joh. 3.18. of Chriſts <hi>being before</hi> Abraham <hi>was,</hi> Joh. 8.58. of his being <hi>omnipotent,</hi> &amp;c. All which are ſpoken of the whole perſon, but properly are to bee referred to the ſeveral natures to which they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Apoſtles ſometimes expound them, and teach us ſo to do; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. Chriſt was mortified <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> and quickened <hi>according to the ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.4. <hi>Hee dyed according to the infirmity of his fleſh,</hi> and was quickned according to the power of God: and to help our conceit herein, ſerveth that ſchool diſtinction,
<note place="margin">Lords Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, non totum Chriſti</note> which ſaith, that <hi>whole Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to do this or that, which the <hi>whole of Chriſt</hi> did not: yea, our own common form of ſpeech ſaith, a man is dead whoſe ſoul liveth, and a man is aſleep when his body only ſleepeth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Wee have hence to note that the ſame body was raiſed which had been laid down in the Grave, and no imaginary body, neither any other body for it; for never was any other laid there before. Of all which himſelf againſt all Hereticks giveth ſufficient evidence, as in the manifeſtation following remaineth to be cleared.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That this perſon raiſed was not a private perſon, but the ſame who had as a publike perſon been abuſed, accuſed, condemned, and executed; and now as a publike perſon alſo raiſed from the dead; in whom all his Church, and every member of it roſe again: for whoſoever have intereſt in his death, have their part alſo in his reſurrection.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Here is a further thing in this perſon to bee noted than ever was in any: the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was a root alſo and a publike perſon; when hee ſinned, hee ſinned for himſelf and us, and having ſinned, and we in him, he dyed away, and left us in that ſin; and being dead wee hear no more of him: and the Scriptures, though they record at large the Hiſtories of the holieſt men that have lived, yet when once they come to this, that ſuch or ſuch a man dyed, wee hear no more of him: but with Chriſt it is not ſo; who was not onely as another <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who bewrayed the greateſt power in his death; but herein unmatchable and peerleſs, that hee did greater things after his death, than ever hee did in all his life:
<note place="margin">Contra. Fauſt. lib. 16.</note> inſomuch as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>that the faith of Chriſtians was Chriſts reſurrection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wee muſt not then content our ſelves, with common people, that Chriſt is dead for all, and no more; but faſten our eyes upon his reſurrection ſo much the more diligently, by how much it is eaſier to beleeve that hee was dead, than that hee roſe again. And what other thing can more fitly bee collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that practice of all the Evangeliſts, who in other things, while ſome of them omit one Hiſtory, ſome another, or elſe ſome of them briefly point at, and lightly touch and paſs over ſome other Hiſtories, all of them ſet themſelves of purpoſe to bee copious and large in this of Chriſts reſurrection; that the faith of Beleevers might bee firmly grounded herein, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe no benefit of his reſurrection, none of his death: and without the certain apprehenſion hereof, all Preaching, and Hearing, and Faith were in vain; and wee our ſelves were yet in our ſins: To which Apoſtolical practice, this of our Apoſtle is not unſuitable in this place in hand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17, 18. who while hee almoſt in one word maketh mention of the death of Chriſt, hee at large proſecuteth and proveth the truth of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond point, is to conſider the perſon that raiſed Chriſt. Him <hi>God</hi>
                        <pb n="339" facs="tcp:40284:176"/> raiſed, that is, God the Father, Act. 2.24. <hi>And have crucified and ſlain, whom God had raiſed: &amp;</hi> 3.15. <hi>Ye have killed the Lord of Life, whom God hath raiſed from the dead.</hi> More plainly is this work attributed to the <hi>mighty power of the Father of glory working in Chriſt, and raiſing him from the dead,</hi> Eph. 1.17, 20. and to him <hi>at whoſe right hand hee ſitteth:</hi> ſo Rom. 4.24. <hi>Wee beleeve in him which raiſed our Lord Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But Christ raiſed himſelf,</hi> Joh. 2.19. <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three daies I will raiſe it again:</hi> and hereby was <hi>hee mightily declared to bee the Son of God by raiſing himſelf from the dead,</hi> Rom. 1.14. In like manner is this reſurrection of his aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. If the Spirit of him which raiſed up Chriſt, &amp;c. <hi>therefore the Father raiſed him not.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is no contrariety, the Father raiſed him, and hee raiſed himſelf. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1 There is but one Deity of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, which is the common foundation of all their actions. 2 There is but one power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all three, and this is the power that Chriſt challengeth hee hath, to lay down his life and take it up again.
<note place="margin">Opera ad extra communia tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus perſonis.</note> 3 There is but one common act in them all three, for the putting out of this power unto any external acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without themſelves; of which Chriſt ſpeaking, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. ſaith, <hi>whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Father doth, the ſame things doth the Son alſo.</hi> In theſe reſpects hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſpeech of the Apoſtle, <hi>Theſe three are one,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.7. that is, theſe three, 1 In the true and real diſtinction of their perſons: 2 In their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proprieties, as to beget, to bee begotten, and proceed: and 3 In their ſeveral offices one to another, as to ſend, and to bee ſent, theſe three are <hi>one</hi> in nature and eſſence, <hi>one</hi> in power and will, and <hi>one</hi> in the act of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all ſuch actions, as without themſelves any of them is ſaid to perform.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Although here is no contrariety, yet here is an order in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or adminiſtration of the perſon to bee obſerved: for the Father as the firſt efficient in order, raiſeth Chriſt as man, by the Son as a ſecond effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in order, and by the Holy Ghoſt as a third. For as it is in all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of creation, ſo is it in all the works of redemption: they are aſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Father eſpecially; not becauſe they agree not unto the other two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but becauſe hee after a peculiar manner worketh them, namely, by the Son, and by the Holy Ghoſt; but they not <hi>by him,</hi> but <hi>from him:</hi> and ſo neither this, or any other ſuch place, where it is aſcribed to the Father to raiſe his Son Jeſus, muſt bee conceived, either as making Chriſt (as the Son) inferiour in power to his Father, or as excluding his own mighty power in raiſing himſelf; for they ſhew onely the order of the perſons, but make no inequality in eſſence, or power, or will, or working.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> where the Son is ſaid to bee raiſed of the Father, it muſt not bee underſtood of the perſon of the Son, but in reſpect of his nature aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that is, his humanity. Whence obſerve, that as the former point ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Chriſt was a true man, becauſe hee was in the ſtate of the dead, whence hee was raiſed; ſo this conſideration ſheweth him to bee a true and glorious God, and notably concludeth that which the Apoſtle aimeth at, who would hence prove him to bee <hi>Lord of all,</hi> in that by his own power hee raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from death; and ſo <hi>mightily declared himſelf the Son of God,</hi> Rom. 1.4.

                        <note place="margin">It was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that Chriſt ſhould riſe again, reaſons.</note> The third point is the <hi>raiſing it ſelf:</hi> wherein three points are to bee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, 1 The <hi>neceſſity</hi> of Chriſts riſing. 2 The <hi>manner.</hi> 3 The <hi>fruit</hi> or ends of it.

                     <p n="1">1 For the accompliſhment of things fore-appointed and foretold: it was from all eternity decreed and appointed by God, and therefore it behoved <hi>Chriſt to riſe from the dead the third day,</hi> Luke 24.46. and it <hi>was impoſſible that he ſhould be held down of death,</hi> Act. 2.24.</p>
                     <p>Again, the Scriptures muſt neceſſarily bee fulfilled, all which beat upon theſe two points, 1 His <hi>ſufferings,</hi> Luk. 24.26. 2 the <hi>glory that ſhould follow,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.11. And more ſpecially all thoſe predictions, and types of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection inforced this neceſſity, Pſal. 16.10. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in grave:</hi> which our Apoſtle proveth cannot bee meant of <hi>David,</hi> whoſe body ſaw corruption; but that <hi>David ſpake concerning him:</hi> Iſa. 53.10. <hi>when hee ſhall make his ſoul an offering for ſin, hee ſhall ſee his ſeed, and prolong his daies:</hi> Beſides his own prediction of his reſurrection, muſt either bee fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or hee could not have been the onely true Prophet of his Church: for himſelf had ſaid, that the Jews ſhould ſlay him and crucify him, but the third day ſhall hee riſe again, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.17. and this the High Prieſts and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees remembred well, when they came to <hi>Pilate</hi> and ſaid. <hi>Sir, wee remember that this deceiver while hee was alive ſaid, within three daies I will riſe: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand therefore that the ſepulchre bee made ſure, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Adde hereunto, that all the predictions of his aſcenſion, of his triumph, and of the laſt judgement, depended hereupon. Further, the types which fore-ſhadowed his reſurrection, muſt not bee fruſtrate, but anſwered in the truth of them: as that of <hi>Jſaac</hi> bound upon the wood, but yet reſerved alive, whom his Father <hi>received from the dead after a ſort:</hi> of <hi>Sampſon</hi> eſcaping the revenge and malice of his enemies, by carrying away the gates wherein hee ſeemed faſt ſhut: of the two goats, one ſlain for ſin, the other a ſcape-goat, ſhadowing Chriſt both ſlain for ſin, and yet eſcaping, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.5. of the two ſparrows, the one killed, the other let flye: and the moſt expreſs of all, that of <hi>Jonah,</hi> which Chriſt himſelf mentioneth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.39. and moſt properly applyeth to this very purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>former,</hi> becauſe hee muſt not onely make a perpetual oblation that need no repetition; but alſo hee muſt <hi>live ever to make interceſſion,</hi> Heb. 7.25. and that perpetually, without which the Apoſtle implyeth that he had not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> ſaved his people. This is moſt clearly proved, Rom. 8.34. <hi>It is Chriſt who dyed;</hi> yea, <hi>or rather which is riſen again: who is alſo at the right hand of God, and maketh interceſſion for us:</hi> and Heb. 9.24. <hi>Chriſt is entered into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heaven to appear now in the ſight of God for us:</hi> which <hi>appearance</hi> of his in Heaven with his Merits, hath the force of the moſt effectual prayer that ever was.</p>

<note place="margin">By dying Chriſt offereth, and by riſing hee applyeth his ſacrifice to the conſcience of beleevers.</note> that hee may not onely make one offering for ſin (as thoſe Prieſts did many) but that hee may alwaies live to apply it (as they did not) and ſee that his people have the benefit of it; not onely before God for the appeaſing of his wrath, but alſo for the purging <hi>of their conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God:</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle noteth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. and in the laſt place to beſtow upon every beleever the ſpirit of faith, whereby they may apprehend, and apply his ſacrifice to their own ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth it any whit impeach the eternity of Chriſts Prieſt-hood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe four thouſand years almoſt of the world were paſſed before hee ſuffered: for howſoever the execution of it was not all thoſe ages after the beginning of the World; yet the vertue, efficacy, and benefit of it, reached to the firſt Beleever that ever was in the World, <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, whoſe faith in <hi>this ſeed of the woman</hi> ſaved him. <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo ſaw his day and rejoyced: and the Holy Ghoſt feareth not to call him the Lamb <hi>ſlain from the beginning of the World,</hi> Rev. 13.8. namely, 1 In Gods Council and Decree. 2 In the vertue and efficacy of his Sacrifice. 3 In regard of Gods acceptation of it for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. 4 In the types and ſhadows of it, whereof the Ceremonial Law was full.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was neceſſary hee ſhould riſe again, becauſe hee was ſo to dye as that thereby hee muſt overcome, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deſtroy death, which hee had not done, if hee had lain conquered of death ſtill in the grave: yea more, hee muſt ſo dye as that hee muſt give <hi>eternal life to his ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10.28. and by his death merit it, put, and hold them in poſſeſſion of it for ever: all ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the phraſes following, <hi>they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any take them out of my hands:</hi> which could never have been accompliſhed, it himſelf had periſhed, and had been left in the hands and houſe of death.

Neither was it ſufficient for Chriſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the former part of his Prieſt-hood, namely ſatisfaction for ſin, if he had not added the latter thereto, which is the application of it. This latter maketh the former ours, and comfortable unto us. And both theſe the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. Chriſt was <hi>delivered to death for our ſins, and is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen again for our juſtification:</hi> where by juſtification is meant by a Metonimy, the application of juſtice.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The ſecond point propounded to bee conſidered of in the riſing of Chriſt, is the manner of it, which will appear in three things: the 1 Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Soul; the 2 his Body; the 3 his whole Humanity ſtanding of both.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the <hi>Soul</hi> of Chriſt which on the Croſſe was ſeparated from the body, commended into the hands of his Father, and tranſlated that ſame day into Paradiſe, was by the mighty power of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, brought back into his dead body, lying in the grave: quickned it, and made it a living body, moving and ſenſible in it ſelf, and unto others.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the ſelf-ſame <hi>Body</hi> which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> educated in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Galilee;</hi> which was apprehended, condemned, crucified, and laid in the Grave, came out of the Grave a living body; God by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Angels removing all lets, looſing the bands and apparrel of death from oft his bleſſed body; by the earthquake tumbled away the ſtone that held him down, drove away the Souldiers for fear, who would have aſſayed to have killed him the ſecond time if they had ſeen him riſe: and ſo opened the Grave, that all might ſee the body was gone.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the whole Humanity was raiſed <hi>glorified.</hi> For 1 His <hi>Body</hi> put off all ſuch infirmities and paſſions as he pleaſed to make trial of for our ſakes, that he might be a more merciful High Prieſt: ſuch as are hunger, thirſt, cold, wearineſſe, pain, and death it ſelf: and contrarily put on ſuch excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as are fit for a glorified body;

                     <p>But here two rules muſt be remembred; the former that none of theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are Divine properties: for although the Deity perſonally inhabiting this
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:40284:178"/> Humane nature, doth adorn it with all perfection of moſt excellent qualities, yet muſt they ſtill be conceived as finite and created accidents, which deſtroy not the nature of a body: they beautifie it, but deifie it not; they make it not omni-preſent nor yet inviſible, for then ſhould it ceaſe to be a body, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſpirit to which only theſe can agree.</p>
                     <p>The latter rule is, that although Jeſus Chriſt roſe moſt glorified, yet did hee ſtill while he was up on earth, veil his Majeſty, and ſhewed not himſelf in that perfect glory, the degrees of which he was now entred into; not only becauſe he would reſerve the fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence alſo although he roſe naked out of the Grave, and left the cloaths behind him (for that was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſtate of a Glorified body, which ſtandeth no more in need of cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for neceſſity nor ornament, than <hi>Adam</hi> did in the ſtate of innocency) yet in reſpect of their infirmity to whom hee was to appear, hee uſed clothes: and although hee needed neither meat nor drink, yet for their ſakes and ours, hee ate and drunk, as wee ſhall after ſee.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as for the ſoul of our bleſſed Saviour, it was beautified with ſuch a meaſure of knowledge as excelled all creatures Men or Angels; even ſuch as was meet for ſuch an head: the God-head revealing unto it all things which either it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now how impoſſible is it that theſe ſhould be the practices of ſuch as live in ſin. Nay, I ſay more, that all the corruption of ſin left in the godly, can ſcarcely bee ſaid to live in them. I grant indeed, ſome moving and ſtirring of it in them, but it is ſuch a motion as is in a beaſt which hath
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:40284:179"/> the throat cut: it ſtrugleth and ſtriveth in letting life go: but the beaſt is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the unclean iſſues of ſin in the godly (which indeed are many) are like ſuch iſſues which come from a dead man, and are a very parting from them, rather than any argument of the life of ſin, or of any delight in them. This is that which the Apoſtle aimeth at, Rom. 6.7. <hi>Hee that is dead, is freed from ſin:</hi> as the Theef once hanged, ſtealeth no more; ſo ſin once dead and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in Chriſt, liveth no more in ſtate or ſtrength: the ſinews of this gyant are cut, and what ſtrength of motion can bee in it? In a word, it is in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers but dying ſin, ſin deſtroyed: the whole Hoſt of ſin is diſcomfited, though ſome ſtraglers of the Army wander here and there as Rebels in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans dominions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Enemy is <hi>Death,</hi> which entered into the World by ſin,
<note place="margin">The ſecond enemy is death.</note> and went over all men, in that all men had ſinned, and ſtandeth in full force and ſtate by ſin whereſoever it reigneth. Now Chriſt by removing the cauſe, hath alſo removed the effect: for ſin being ſlain, death is alſo ſwallowed up in victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: he hath made his word good, <hi>O death I will be thy death;</hi> who although he bee the laſt enemy that ſhall bee fully deſtroyed, yet hath hee diſarmed him, taken away his dart and ſting from him, and ſo ſpoiled him, as hee hath left him nothing to harm the elect withall.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> Enemy is <hi>Hell,</hi> the gates of which was ſet wide open by ſin; for,

                        <hi>In the day thou ſinneſt, thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> namely, the ſecond death as well as the former. But Jeſus Chriſt, by deſcending into Hell, and ſuffering the ſorrows of the ſecond death, looſed the ſame from himſelf, and all ſuch as ſhall beleeve in his name unto the worlds end: Rev. 1.18. <hi>I was dead, but am alive for evermore, Amen: and I have the keys of Hell and Death:</hi> which phraſe ſeemeth to bee borrowed from great Commanders and Conquerours, who having won and entered any City, preſently have the keyes delivered unto them, in token of that regiment and authority which now of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto them; and plainly importeth, that howſoever Chriſt was once dead, yet by his death hee hath vanquiſhed Hell and Death, and ſo hath obtained full power and command over them both.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Enemy is <hi>Satan,</hi> the arch enemy of mankinde; moſt malitious,
<note place="margin">The fourth Satan.</note> being a man-ſlayer from the beginning, and moſt powerful, being the Prince, yea, the God of this world: yet hath the victorious Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> put to flight this roaring Lyon: whoſe rage and malice made him bold to ſet upon the Son of God himſelf, that ſo hee might work his own ruine and overthrow. How Chriſt avoided his ſundry fierce aſſaults, and temptations in the wilderneſs; broke his power and forces by his powerful diſ-poſſeſſing and caſting him out of men and women; trod upon his neck by the power of his death and reſurrection, wee might at large out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts ſhew, but that wee have ſpent ſome time already in this argument: ſo as now the gates of Hell can never prevail againſt the Faith of the godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſeed of the Woman hath broken the Serpents head: the ſtrong man is caſt out by a ſtronger than hee: the ſpoiler is ſpoyled, and lead in triumph by him that <hi>appeared</hi> for this end, to <hi>deſtroy the works of the Devil:</hi> who hath this Tyrant alſo in chains reſerved for the blackneſſe of darkneſs for ever.</p>
                     <p>The laſt enemy, but not the leaſt in ſtrength, is the <hi>World,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The fifth, the world.</note> Satans ſervant and armour-bearer; which by all the power and policy it could uſe, could not keep Chriſt down in the grave, but hee roſe again notwithſtanding all the oppoſition of it: this is that our Saviour profeſſeth of himſelf a little before his death; <hi>Bee of good comfort, for I have overcome the world,</hi> Joh. 16.33. As if hee had ſaid, trouble not your hearts, although you have all the ſtrength and malice of the wicked world againſt you, all which ſhall bee no more able to prejudice your ſalvation, or hinder your glory, than mine own,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:40284:180"/> who have overcome it, ſo as you fight againſt a Conquered Enemy. By all this that hath been ſaid, that of the Apoſtle appeareth to bee true: that hee hath <hi>ſubdued all things unto himſelf, and hath put all his enemies under his feet,</hi> that none nor all of them can ſeparate us from God or Chriſt, or our ſalvation purchaſed and preſerved for us by him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How all theſe enemies are not only ſoyl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, but after a ſort made friendly unto us.</note> Now wee are to ſee in the next place, that Chriſt by his reſurrection, hath not onely ſpoyled theſe enemies for us, but that hee hath made them all after a ſort friendly unto us; that whereas they deſire ſtill indeed, and ſeem to wound us, they do nothing elſe but heal us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 For ſin, that now ſerveth to humble Gods Children and keep them low in their own eyes, as alſo provoketh them to walk awfully in regard of God, and watchfully over their hearts and lives, ſtill groaning to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their daily infirmities. By this means <hi>out of the eater commeth meat,</hi> as was ſaid in <hi>Sampſons</hi> riddle, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Death</hi> is not now to Gods Children as it was to Chriſt, joyned with a ſence of Gods anger againſt it, or paying a debt to the Juſtice of God (for it were againſt the rule of Gods Juſtice to require the payment of the ſame debt twice) but wherein they have a ſweet ſenſe of Gods Fatherly love, wherein ſin is perfectly to bee aboliſhed, whereby way and entrance is made unto life everlaſting, where wee ſhall bee with God and Jeſus Chriſt, which is beſt of all. The Saints of God in theſe regards have rather deſired than feared it: for what man having been toſſed a long time upon a dangerous Sea, would fear the Haven? or who being wearied with the Travels of the day, would fear to go to his reſt at night?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Sence of <hi>Hell</hi> keepeth in us an hatred of ſin, and a longing after Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: yea, how beneficial the terrors of Conſcience are to Gods Children, were too long here to diſcourſe. The ſpeech is as true as common, the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lyeth by hell gates.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The <hi>Devil</hi> maketh us fly to God our help, and rely upon his ſtrength: yea, when men by no other means will bee drawn, God ſetteth the Devil in their necks to drag them to Heaven, as a grave Divine ſpeaketh,</p>
                     <p n="5">5 All the evils in the world work to the beſt to them that love God, and haſten them to the fruition of the victory obtained by Chriſt: they wean them from the World, and the love of it. And whereas they are as prone to pitch their Tabernacles here below as others, God uſeth theſe as means to keep his from being of the World, even while they are in it. They conform them to Jeſus Chriſt their head, and train them in the imitation of him, both in patience and obedience. Now how could any of theſe parcels of Gods curſe againſt the ſin of man, or mans curſed ſin it ſelf, bring to any ſuch ſweet and profitable fruits, but by the over-ruling power of Jeſus Chriſt, who bringeth life out of death, light out of darkneſs; and who onely can make his own wiſe, out of a rank poyſon to ſuck moſt ſweet and ſovereign preſervatives? which who doth not, hee never as yet knew the benefit of Chriſt his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

The benefits which I will mention are three.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, We are confirmed hereby in the whole truth of all our Religion; the main foundation of which laid by all the Prophets and Apoſtles, is, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> was the Son of God, the true Meſſiah, perfect God and perfect man: and ſo indeed hee was ſuch a one as hee was foretold to bee: one that was to dye, and yet ſaw no <hi>corruption:</hi> one who muſt make
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:40284:180"/> his ſoul an <hi>offering</hi> for ſin, and yet <hi>muſt ſurvive to ſee his ſeed,</hi> and prolong <hi>his daies:</hi> one that had power to <hi>lay down his Life,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18</note> and power <hi>to take it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> In a word, one that <hi>was put to death concerning the fleſh,</hi> but <hi>was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſpirit:</hi> that is, by vertue <hi>of his Deity,</hi> raiſing that fleſh up again. Let all the Jews and Atheiſts in the earth deſpiſe the indignity of his death, we with the Angels will admire the glory of his reſurrection.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The <hi>ſecond</hi> benefit is, that hence wee are aſſured that our 1 Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 Sanctification, 3 Perfect ſalvation, is not only obtained, but apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 For our <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God, by means of Chriſt his reſurrection, hee brought in to us an everlaſting righteouſneſſe; in that hee not only bare our burden upon himſelf, but bare it away from us: for what is his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection elſe but his actual abſolution from our ſins which were imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and for which hee ſubjected himſelf unto the death? Whence wee grow up in full aſſurance, that the whole price is not onely paid to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt on Chriſts part, but that the ſatisfaction is accepted alſo on his Fathers, whoſe juſtice would never have abſolved him, if all the Bills and Writings which were to bee laid againſt us, had not been faſtned to the Croſs, and ſo cancelled and fully diſcharged: ſo as now wee may with the Apoſtle, hold out a flagge of defiance, and challenge our righteouſneſs; <hi>for who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth; who ſhall condemn? it is Chriſt which is dead,</hi> yea, <hi>or rather which is riſen again,</hi> Rom. 8.34. And the ſame Apoſtle thirſting after that <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> which is by Faith in him, counteth all things loſs and dung, ſave onely to <hi>know him, and the vertue of his reſurrection,</hi> Phil. 3.10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 From this Reſurrection of Chriſt iſſueth our ſanctification, which is our firſt reſurrection or raiſing of our ſouls from the death of ſin: becauſe in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reconciliation-making muſt bee two conditions. 1 A forgetting upon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, of all old wrongs and injuries. 2 A binding from future offences: the former Chriſt effecteth by his death, the latter by his reſurrection, into the which whoſoever <hi>are grafted, they cannot hence-forth ſerve ſin,</hi> Rom. 6.5, 6. but being riſen with Chriſt, they <hi>ſeek the things which are above,</hi> Coloſ. 3.1. where Chriſt ſitteth: they ceaſe further by ſin to offend, as ſuch who are <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to a lively hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from the dead, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and for this cauſe our Saviour was careful after his departure hence, to ſend out his Spirit in more plentiful and abundant manner than before, that hee might continually inſpire his people with ardent deſires after the beginnings of that life eternal unto which Chriſt himſelf is riſen: who then manifeſt themſelves members of ſuch an advanced head, when this new life manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf in them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, our perfect ſalvation is alſo hence fully aſſured us; for if our Lord Jeſus hath ſoyled all the powers of Hell, Death, and Darkneſs in himſelf, when hee was yet dead; how much more doth hee it for us his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, being now alive? if hee could drive back and diſperſe all ſpiritual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitles even when hee was in Hell it ſelf after a ſort, how much more now being aſcended <hi>far above all moveable and aſpectible Heavens?</hi> Eph. 4.10. for wee muſt not behold the victory and triumph of Chriſt,

                     <p>And hence, as out of a well of conſolation, wee ſhall draw this comfort to our ſelves, that look as the gates of Hell could not prevail againſt him

                     <p>Adde hereunto, that death itſelf, nor the grave ſhall ſtand between us and home: for this riſing of Chriſt is both the cauſe and confirmation that we ſhall riſe again: If the head bee riſen, ſo ſhall alſo the members: if Chriſt the firſt fruits of them that ſleep be raiſed, ſo ſhall alſo the whole bulk and body of beleevers: if we beleeve that Chriſt is riſen <hi>from the dead, even ſo them which ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.14. and if <hi>the ſame ſpirit which raiſed Jeſus from the dead dwell in us, then he that raiſed Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken our mortal bodies,</hi> Rom. 8.11. for Chriſt hath not redeemed the ſoul alone from death, but the body alſo: elſe had this ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> been interiour to the firſt, if not able to ſave by his riſing all that which was loſt by the fall of the former. Oh how would this meditation well digeſted, ſweeten the remembrance of death and the grave? when a Chriſtian ſhall conſider, that look how it was with Chriſt when his ſoul and body were ſeparated, yet both of them were united to the Deity, which brought them together again: even ſo I am taught by the Scriptures, that when my ſoul and body ſhall bee ſeparated, yet ſhall neither of them be ſundred from Chriſt my head, but he will reunite them like loving friends that they may participate in his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. How would this meditation bring the ſoul not only to be content but to deſire <hi>to bee diſſolved, and bee with Chriſt,</hi> accounting that <hi>the beſt of all, Phil.</hi> 1.23.</p>

                           </gap> In the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this life.</note> the Natural man will follow and purſue things which tend to a ſenſual and natural life; he will beat his brains for gold and ſilver, meat and cloth, goods and lands for himſelf and his: as for Heaven, he will have nothing to doe there till he be dead, and for the way thither, hee cateth not to know it till he be dying at the ſooneſt.</p>
                     <p>But the Spiritual man, hee coveteth after Spiritual things: the power of Chriſts Spirit where it is preſent, will lift up his heart be it never ſo heavie, to ſeek the Kingdom and the righteouſneſſe or it, and hee ſeeketh after the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; as for gold and treaſures, he accounteth of the graces of faith, love, hope, humility, and the fear of the Lord above all pearls and precious things; he provideth for himſelf and his, the food that periſheth not, and thinketh h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mſelf warmly and comely arrayed, when he hath put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as knowing, that only the garment of his righteouſneſſe, can fence him from all the injury of wind and weather.</p>
                     <p>The Natural man doth not more ſeriouſly liſten after great purchaſes of Lands and Fields, as he doth caſt with himſelf to purchaſe the pearl hid in the field; for which he will ſell himſelf, as we ſay, into his ſhirt; nay and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how own ſelf, liberty, life, and if he had any thing dearer than that.</p>
                     <p>The Spiritual man, as for the things of this life, if he have them not, hee wanteth not his portion: If he have them, his care is that they have not him, or become his portion: If riches increaſe, he ſetteth not his heart upon them: If they decreaſe, his heart faileth not with them. In abundance, he carrieth himſelf warily and weanedly. In want, cheerfully and contentedly. The things hee hath, he uſeth as not uſing them: the things hee hath not, hee knoweth he hath no good uſe of them, or elſe he ſhould have them. And thus as the Natural man beſtirreth himſelf, and all his motion tendeth to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of his outward eſtate at home; ſo contrarily doth an heavenly-minded man (accounting himſelf from home while he is here in the body) bend his chief care to ſettle his eſtate at home in heaven; and all his trading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in this ſtrange Country tendeth to the enriching of him in his own Country.</p>
                     <p>Further, if we look to the Natural mans courſe in the matter of his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall ſee as great difference between them. For it is clear,
<note place="margin">2 In the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion.</note> that whereas matters of religion are a burthen to the one, they are the joy of the other. The
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40284:182"/> one as heavie to pray, to hear, to read and meditate on the Word, and of his own eſtate, as a Bear to the ſtake: if Law, of ſhame, or ſome ſuch by-reſpect moved him not, if were all one to him to bee on his Horſe-back as in the Church: the other, would account his life tedious, were it not for theſe mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of God and his people in the aſſemblies, and thoſe ſweet refreſhments they bring back from thence.</p>
                     <p>The one, if he pray ſometimes in publick, hee maketh little conſcience of private prayer in his family, and ſo of other private duties, to which God and a good conſcience would bind him as ſtraight as to the former.</p>
                     <p>The other, walketh wiſely and religiouſly in the midſt of his houſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the worſhip of God at home, and maketh his houſe a little Church and houſe of God.</p>
                     <p>The one, maketh little or no conſcience of ſuch ſins, as either in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of other, or in his own corrupt conceit, are ſmaller ſins: ſuch as are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior oathes, idleneſſe, gaming, ſins of omiſſion, idle words of hurtful; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean or wandring thoughts: words he thinketh to be but wind, if he mean no hurt; and if he mean hurt, but doe none, thoughts are free. As for the ſins of the time, he will not be ſo undiſcreet as to ſwim againſt the ſtream; hee is here violently carried without reſiſtance into a gulf of known evils, and all is well, he doth but as others doe, and it were worſe for him if hee did not.</p>
                     <p>The other, maketh conſcience of all ſin, leſſer ſins, and ſecret ſins: hee can hate all, even thoſe which he cannot avoyd: hee hateth the evil that himſelf doth, and willingly will not diſpleaſe God though all men bee therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him. To conclude this point, the one ſeeketh to appprove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto man; the other to approve his heart to God, becauſe he knoweth he made it, and knoweth what is in it. And this ſhall ſerve for a taſt of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite diſpoſition between Natural, and Spiritual life.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Agreement which it hath with the life of the Saints in Heaven, in two things.</note> II. The ſecond note, to diſcern this heavenly life by, <hi>is the ſimilitude or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which it hath with the life of the Saints in heaven.</hi> For the life of the Saints in Heaven, muſt be a counterpane of the beleevers upon earth, to which they muſt be daily framed in ſundry regards. 1 In reſpect of the things they are called from. 2 In reſpect of the things they are called unto.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The Saints in Heaven are called from three things. 1 The world it ſelf. 2 The corruptions that are in the world through luſt. 3 The company of the wicked of the world. Even ſo muſt beleevers in the world in their degree and meaſure, carry themſelves as thoſe that are choſen out of the world, and ſuch as are <hi>bought from the earth,</hi> Rev. 14.3. medling no more wich earthly things than needs muſt, enjoying them ſo, as they joy no more in them, than in things which are not their own, but borrowed only for a time: uſing them ſo, as they abuſe them not, becauſe they are to be countable for them; abiding in them earthly buſineſſe and callings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <note place="margin">What the Saints are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from, in three things</note> ſo as they be never earthly minded: in one word, ſo deſiring, purſuing, having, holding, and parting from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of this life, as thoſe to whom God hath ſhewed better things, than any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; yea, and eſteeming of their preſent life it ſelf ſo indifferently, as that they can account the day of their death better than the day wherein they were born.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 As the Saints in Heaven, being delivered out of the priſon of the body, have all the bolts and chains of their corruption ſtruck off; ſo the godly who have their parts in the firſt reſurrection, have after a ſort changed their lives, and put on a <hi>Divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. they have bid farewell to the follies of their former times, yea renounce, and as farre as frailty will permit, loathe their ſins; ſaying unto them, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> to his rejected Idols, <hi>get you hence: what have I to doe with you?</hi> they that were of the Synagogue of Satan, are now in the Temple with true beleevers. Thus is it ſaid of the hundred forty four
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40284:182"/> thouſand, that were bought from the earth, that were not <hi>defiled with women,</hi> but were <hi>virgins,</hi> that is ſanctified in part, and waſhed from their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and will have no more fellowſhip in the unfruitful works of darkneſs, wherein ſometimes they were chief actors.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Saints in heaven never joyn with the wicked of the world any more; that being verified, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to the Iſraelites, concerning the Egyptians, <hi>The enemies whom your eyes have ſeen this day, you ſhall never ſee more:</hi> even to the faithful hate the company of the wicked, with whom they can neither do good, nor take any: whereas before their calling, they were mixt with them, and ran with them to the ſame exceſs of riot. Now their fellowſhip is diſſolved, they are no more Companions with them; the light of the one admitteth no communion with the others darkneſs: and that they are often forced to dwell in <hi>Meſech</hi> with them, it is the woe and grief of their hearts.</p>
                     <p>Another part of this agreement,
<note place="margin">What the Saints are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto in five things,</note> ſtandeth in the things to which the Saints are called, which are ſundry. As, 1 Look as their chief happineſs ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the beholding of the face of God, and ſeeing him as he is, together with their rejoycing in his bleſſed communion; and that moſt ſweet fellowſhip they have one with another; even ſo the chief bleſſedneſſe of the Saints in earth, is their fellowſhip with God and Chriſt, though it bee not ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate as the former. They ſee his back parts indeed rather than his face, and rejoyce after a ſort in his face, but afar off; and as in a glaſs of the Word and Sacraments, not face to face, nor in that brightneſs wherein they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, when they are at home with him at his right hand: but yet what they want in the thing, they want not in deſire to be where hee is, that they may ſee his glory, ſo as they may be ſatisfied with the fulneſſe of it; that they may ſo ſee him, as they may bee like him; that they may drink (not of the ſtreams, but) of the well of life, and ſee light in his light. And becauſe loving him that begat, they cannot but love him that is begotten: the next happineſs to the former, do the godly juſtly eſteem the communion of Saints, placing under God their chief delight in ſuch as excel in vertue.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as the heavenly life of the Saints is ſpent in the perfect praiſe of God, wherein they imploy their eternity, keeping in the preſence of the Throne of God a perpetual Sabbath, and ſerving him day and night:
<note place="margin">Rev. 11.17. &amp; 7.15.</note> even ſo beleevers indeavour in their meaſure, that the ſame mind bee in them which was in Jeſus Chriſt, who thought it as his meat and drink to do the will of his heavenly Father: they bring free-will-offerings: they eſteem one day better in his Courts, than a thouſand beſides: and account theſe perſons bleſſed that may dwell in his houſe, becauſe they ever <hi>praiſe him.</hi> Not that much rebellion and corruption of nature, doth not often dead and dul even the moſt ſanctified; but yet ſomething they get forward; and delight in the progreſs they make to the chearful praiſe and worſhip of God. And this they do, not by fits and ſtarts but imitate that heavenly life in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual indeavour, to make the pleaſing of God their principal delight, and the chief thing that moſt ſoliciteth them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, as the Saints in Heaven live according to the Law of perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is the Law and charter of Heaven, and have obtained perfect ſanctification: ſo Beleevers on earth ſet the ſame Law before them, to rule and direct every particular action by, and begin the ſelf ſame obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: they begin to weigh all they give out or take in by the weights of the ſanctuary, which God hath ſealed as juſt: they follow the Lamb whither-ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goeth before them, whether by voice or example.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, as the Saints in heaven enjoy God for the means of all their lives, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3, 5. for hee is their Temple, their light, their Tree of Life, their Cryſtal river, &amp;c. evenſo the Saints in the World, though they live
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40284:183"/> by means, and muſt not look to reap without ſowing, as once it was, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.29. yet injoy they God above all means; and acknowledge that hee is their life, and the length of their daies; that they live not by bread alone, but by every word proceeding out of the mouth of God: that it is hee that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them power to get ſubſtance, and bleſſeth their children with increaſe: that hee which cloatheth the Lillies, and feedeth the Sparrows, will cloathe and feed them: yea and more, that before they ſhall want that which is good for them, it all means ſhould fail, hee would ſuſtain them without means, by Miracle: that his Promiſe cannot fail them, when the Indian Mines ſhall come to nought: that his word is means enough, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the Rock, and it giveth water; and the Winds, and they blow Quails before his Hoſt ſhall periſh.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, as the Saints in Heaven would not for all the world forgo their Happineſs for one day, and yet are they not now ſo fully happy, but that they ſtill wait and long for further perfection of their glory; ſaying, <hi>Lord, how long, Holy, and Juſt?</hi> Rev. 6.10, ſo the godly would not for all the world be ſeparated from their eſtate in Chriſt.

And yet dwell they not in theſe firſt fruits, but wait ſtill for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of this their redemption. Hence the Apoſtle deſcribeth them by their inſeparable property, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. which is, <hi>to love the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8.</p>
                     <p>Theſe notes laid together,

                     <p>Which if it bee, then how few have their converſation there, or are riſen with Chriſt? How few are ſet free from the power of ſin, witneſſeth the general reign of it every where. How many mind onely earthly things; how many minde them principally?

How unpleaſant and unwelcome a voice is it, to call men to delight in God and his Children? How heavy are they to the parts of his Worſhip? comming unto them, as if they went to ſome puniſhment? How are mens Luſts become their Laws, inſtead of the perfect Rule and Law of God? every man almoſt living as <hi>Iſrael</hi> when there was no King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. How do men reſt in the means of their warfare, with-drawing their hearts from the author of it? How few prize the life of Chriſtianity, how many ſcorn it in themſelves and others? How many wiſh in their hearts there were no other life to come, and that they rather had good aſſurance of this which is preſent? and inſtead of wiſhing and waiting, tremble at the mention of Chriſt his comming again? Yet moſt of theſe men, profeſſors of Chriſt: all of them baptized into his name; and all of them will bee repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40284:183"/> as good Chriſtians as the beſt.

                     <p>The firſt day of the three, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is to bee reckoned by his latter part, in which Chriſt was dead and buried, not paſſing three hours of the four and twenty; yet ſo as both the night before when the Jews day begun, and the moſt of that day was ſpent in taking, examining, whipping, miſuſing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, and executing him. The ſecond day is to bee accounted wholly and perfect; from the evening of the day before the Paſſeover, to the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath following; ſtanding of full four and twenty hours. The third day is to bee accounted from the former part of it, beginning at the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of the Jewiſh Sabbath: for Chriſt lay all night, neer twelve hours, in the grave, and roſe in the morning betime about the midſt of that natural day, ſtanding of four and twenty hours. And thus is Chriſt truely ſaid to have riſen the third day.</p>
                     <p>Now that Chriſt ſhould riſe the third day, and no ſooner, nor later, theſe reaſons ſhew.
<note place="margin">Why Chriſt would riſe no ſooner than the third day.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 Hee muſt riſe the third day, <hi>according to the Scriptures,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.4. For they had foretold this to bee the particular time, Hoſ. 6.2. <hi>After two daies he will revive us; and in the third day hee will raiſe us up;</hi> namely, in his own perſon: for wee alſo were raiſed with him, as wee have ſeen. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had alſo further figured this diſtinct time in the type of <hi>Jonas,</hi> who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lain three daies and three nights in the belly of the Whale, was the third day caſt on the dry land: as our Saviour himſelf while hee was yet alive, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of himſelf, Matth. 12.40. <hi>As</hi> Jonas <hi>was in the belly of the Whale three daies and three nights, ſo ſhall the Son of Man bee three daies and three nights in the heart of the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 It pleaſed him not to riſe ſooner: hee would not preſently come down from the Croſs, nor revive himſelf before hee was buried, nor riſe preſently after hee was laid down, as hee eaſily could; becauſe hee would manifeſt that hee was truely dead: as alſo becauſe hee would lead his Church into ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, therefore hee roſe not till the caſe ſeemed deſperate: Luke 24.21. <hi>Wee truſted that it had been hee that ſhould have delivered</hi> Iſrael: <hi>and as touching all theſe things, this is the third day that they were done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, hee would no longer defer his riſing.
<note place="margin">Why he would no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his riſing.</note> 1 Leſt hee ſhould utterly have endangered the faith of the Diſciples, which in that ſhort time was ſore ſhaken; as not onely the former example, but the heavineſſe of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples themſelves to beleeve the news of it, and wilfulneſs of <hi>Thomas,</hi> plainly bewraveth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Becauſe upon this event and keeping touch in this very circumſtance of time, hee had laid all the credit of his Perſon, Miniſtry, Doctrin, Miracles, Life and Death. For when they come to ask him a ſign to prove himſelf the Meſſiah, hee referreth them to this event after his death: that when they had deſtroyed the Temple of his body, if hee did raiſe it either after or before
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40284:184"/> the third day, or did not on that day raiſe it, they ſhould never take him for the Meſſiah. And of this very circumſtance <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>men</hi> had taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from his own mouth, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.7. when the women came to the Sepulchre to ſeek Chriſt after he was newly riſen, the Angels told them, he was riſen, he was not there: and further wiſheth them to remember what he had ſaid to them while he was with them, that the <hi>third day he muſt riſe again:</hi> nay not only his friends, but his very enemies had got this by the end, and therefore came to <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Sir, we remember that this Deceiver ſaid, that he would riſe the third day:</hi> let us take ſuch order that the laſt error become not worſe than the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The bleſſed body of Chriſt was not to enter into the leaſt or loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of corruption, and therefore he would lye no longer in the houſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how could his body be preſerved ſo long, ſeeing</hi> Lazarus <hi>his body, and our bodies in that time enter into many degrees of it?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt was indeed balmed and ſweetned with Odours: but all this could not have preſerved him, if his ſoul and body had not now been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a promiſe of a good Land: they muſt in the mean time ſuffer much oppreſſion in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> for the ſpace of four hundred and thirty years together: but the ſelf-ſame night, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. when the term was expired, they went out againſt the heart, and yet at the entreaty of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now the chief Reaſons of this dealing of the Lords with his Children, are theſe,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In Gods delaies there is a ſeaſonable time for all the graces which he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:40284:185"/> to be ſet on work, ſuch as are faith, patience, hope, prayer; all which ceaſe in the accompliſhment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hee will have his childrens caſe often deſperate, that his own hand may bee acknowledged in giving them unexpected deliverance. How could <hi>Iſrael</hi> but acknowledge his out-ſtretched arm in their delivery, when they ſaw nothing but the mountains before them, the enemies behind them, and the ſea as a wall on either ſide? and if the Lord had delivered them before they came into the bottom of the ſea (as he eaſily could have done) the glory of his work had been obſcured, which all ages ſince have admired and extolled till this day. How did <hi>Jonah</hi> and the <hi>Ninevites</hi> acknowledge the finger of God, in calling him to that Miniſtery, when as he ſeemed utterly caſt away, being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Whales belly three days and three nights? for when by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Word of God, the Fiſh was commanded to caſt him on the dry ground, what a worthy fruit of converſion it had in them generally, the Hiſtory doth declare. What great glory the Lord won to himſelf by ſaving <hi>Daniel,</hi> (not from the Den,) but from the Lions teeth in the Den: and the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, (not from the Furnace,) but the very fire in the Furnace; it appeareth, in that the very Heathen Kings themſelves made publick Edicts, that no God, but <hi>Daniels,</hi> and no God but <hi>Shadrachs,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould bee worſhipped through all their Dominions, becauſe no God could deliver their worſhippers as hee had done.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Lord often longer abſenteth himſelf from his own children, that when he is returned, they might make the more account of him; it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to deal herein as a Mother with her child, who although ſhe bee ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der enough over it, will ſometimes get her out of ſight, and behind a door; in the mean time the child falleth and getteth ſome knocks, and all this to make the child perceive its own weakneſſe, and depend upon her ſo much the more. Example hereof we have, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4. when the Church had ſought her beloved in her bed, in the ſtreets, among the Watch-men, and found him not, at laſt, after much ſeeking and ſorrowing after him, ſhe findeth him whom her ſoul loved: then ſhe <hi>took hold on him, and would not let him goe, till ſhe had brought him to the houſe of her mother.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Tedious and heavie afflictions may not bee an argument of Gods hatred. It is a ſimple opinion of ſimple people, that God loveth not that man, who is exerciſed with any ſtrange croſſe, eſpecially if it be more laſting and lingring upon him.
<note place="margin">Lingring affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions no ſign of Gods hatred.</note> Why doſt thou not conſider, ignorant man, that the Lord ſuffered his own wel-beloved Son to lye in the Grave till the third day, before he raiſed him up? What ſayeſt thou to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> did they ceaſe to be the people of God, or to be dear to God, when the heavieſt tasks were laid upon them? Whoſe bloud was it that <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> made the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> run with, but the Saints? In the Perſecutions of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, we read of thirty thouſand of the dear Saints of God put to death in ſeventeen days under the Tyrant <hi>Maximinian,</hi> and as many chained under met als and mines, Who was it that asked if the Lord would <hi>abſent himſelf for ever,</hi> and whether <hi>his mercy was clean gone for evermore?</hi> Was not this the voyce of <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart? Wouldſt thou hear the ſtyle of Gods children in the Scriptures? thou heareſt them called <hi>worms of</hi> Jacob, <hi>dead men of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.14. Wouldeſt thou know their ſtate? nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that unanſwerable to that ſtile: read <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. from verſe thirty five to the thirty ninth, <hi>They wandred in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins;</hi> and they <hi>(of whom the world was not worthy)</hi> were baniſhed the world, as unworthy to live in it. Impoſſible therefore it is, as <hi>Salomon</hi> teacheth, <hi>to know love or hatred by any thing before a man,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.

                     <p n="2">2 Becauſe ſome things remained to bee done by Jeſus Chriſt, between his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, which craved his manifeſt preſence. As, 1 Hee was further to inſtruct his Diſciples in <hi>the things which appertained to the Kingdome of God;</hi> namely, in all the Doctrin they were to teach, and all the Ordinances they were to obſerve, in the external government of the Chriſtian Churches unto the end of the World: and therefore the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt ſheweth us, how Chriſt begun at <hi>Moſes, and all the Prophets; and opened unto them in all the Scriptures, the things that were written of him,</hi> Luk. 24.27, 32. and not onely the Scriptures, but <hi>their eyes, and their hearts, to underſtand and bee warmed and affected with the ſame.</hi> 2 Hee was to eſtabliſh and ſend out into all the world in his own perſon, the Apoſtles to Preach the Goſpel; which hee pleaſed to defer till this time, when by his glorious reſurrection they might ſee, that all <hi>power was given him in heaven and in earth,</hi> Mat. 18.19.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Hee was to confirm this their extraordinary Miniſtery, by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Sacrament, namely, <hi>breathing upon them,</hi> and <hi>giving them the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Joh. 20.22. that is, ſome ſmaller meaſure of gifts, as a pledge for the time; but directing them alſo when and where to expect the plentiful pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Spirit upon them after his departure: as it was moſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly performed in the day of Pentecoſt, after they had a while waited at <hi>Jeruſalem for the Promiſe of the Father,</hi> Act. 1.4.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Hee was by Miracle to confirm to his Diſciples the truth of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that they might bee the better fitted to the teſtimony of it, as hee did by that miraculous draught of fiſh, whereby they <hi>knew that hee was the Lord,</hi> Joh. 21.7, 12.</p>

                        <pb n="359" facs="tcp:40284:186"/>5 In that alſo hee was (according to that which the Scriptures had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophecyed of him, and himſelf alſo often foretold) to aſcend up bodily and viſibly into Heaven, whence he deſcended, ſo to ſhew himſelf the Son of God, and our High Prieſt lifted up higher than the Heavens;
<note place="margin">Luk. 14.33. cum 51.</note> to open Heaven for us, and carry our fleſh before hand thither, where in the mean time hee maketh requeſts for us: it was meet in <hi>the preſence of all the eleven,</hi> Act. 1.9. and <hi>they all beholding,</hi> that hee ſhould openly, and according to his body bee viſibly and locally taken up, as the Angels witneſſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11.</p>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But why did not Chriſt after his Reſurrection, ride in an open triumph before all the People? In all reaſon it would have made much to the confuſion of his enemies, and the comfort of his friends. It could not have been but if he had riſen in the ſight of the Souldiers, and had gone into</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>among the Scribes and Phariſees, into the Temple among the Doctors, into</hi> Pilates <hi>Palace; they would all have been ſtricken down, and confounded in the remembrance of their ſo cruel and wicked a fact, if they had been ſo plainly and ſenſibly convinced of it.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee may not ſuffer our folly to preſcribe to the Wiſdome of God,
<note place="margin">Chriſt moſt not ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo openly as to all the people after his reſurrection, Why.</note> whoſe waies are not our waies. The fooliſhneſs of God, is wiſer than men, and the weakneſs of God, is ſtronger than men. And there bee ſundry juſt reaſons why Chriſt neither would, nor did ſo openly ſhew himſelfe. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Hee declareth hereby that his Kingdome is not of this World; for then hee would have ſhewed himſelf unto the World, whereas after hee roſe from death, hee would not ſhew himſelf but to thoſe of his own Kingdome. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needeth hee for the furthering of his Kingdome the help or witneſs of the great ones in the world: for then would he not have paſſed by the Scribes and Phariſees, the Doctors and great Rabbies, whoſe words would eaſily have been taken, and ſhewed himſelf to a few poor and abject men and women. Neither cometh his Kingdom <hi>with outward pomp and obſervation,</hi> Luk. 17.21. as Humane Kingdomes do; his triumph is correſpondent to his conqueſt; both of them ſpiritual and inward, not diſcernable but to the eye of the ſoul.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The time was now come wherein Chriſt was not to bee known any <hi>lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger according to the fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.16. the World that had ſo known him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt know him ſo no more; but onely by diſpenſation for the time, that ſuch as were to witneſs of him, might take the better notice of him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The wicked had made themſelves unworthy to ſee him any more: and this was a part of the juſt judgement of God upon them, who had ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpighted him: they ſaw him once, and were ſufficiently convinced by the Scriptures, by his Miracles, his Life, and his Doctrin: all which becauſe they deſpiſed, and wilfully thruſt the Kingdome of God from them, they are juſtly left of God and Chriſt, and permitted to bee further blinded, that they may up-heap the meaſure of their ſins.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 As for the godly, the Lord would not have their Faith to depend upon the witneſs of the eyes and ſight of the wicked and ungodly; but upon a Divine teſtimony, namely, upon ſuch as were appointed of God for it: and this is a ſure ground of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 If Chriſt had openly appeared to all the people, hee had falſified his own word, who had threatned them, that becauſe when hee would have gathered them as an Hen her Chickens under her wing, but they would not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.39. they ſhould not thenceforth <hi>ſee him</hi> till they could ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is hee that commeth in the name of the Lord.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:40284:187"/> namely, after you have crucified me, yee ſhall not ſee me till the end of the world, when I ſhall come again; which coming ſome few of you, namely, that are elect, ſhall gratulate unto me, and ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi> And perhaps (as ſome interpret it) all you who now reject me, as a vile perſon; will then, but too late, and to no profit of your own, either by force, or in imitation of the godly, acknowledge me the bleſſed that cometh in the name of the Lord: and to this alſo maketh that. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.64. where giving a reaſon of his confeſſion to <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he was the Chriſt the Son of God; he telleth them, that they ſhall hereafter <hi>ſee the Son of man;</hi> but not before he be <hi>ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the Clouds of heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 It appeareth that many more of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were more convinced in their Conſciences, and pricked in their hearts for crucifying the Lord of glory, by the preaching and miniſtery of the Apoſtles; than they would have been by the ſight of Chriſt himſelf. In the ſecond, fourth, fifth, and ſeventh Chapters of the Acts it evidently appeareth, how by the Apoſtles direct dealing againſt their ſins, many thouſands were converted at ſome one Sermon: and how many were daily added unto the Church, whoſe faith was farre more ſound in that they attained the bleſſing which Chriſt pronounced upon thoſe that beleeved, and yet had not ſeen.</p>
                     <p>All which teacheth us, that in matter of Divinity, wee muſt always ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to Gods wiſdome, ſhutting up our own eyes; If we have a word to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve any thing, or to doe any thing, although our reaſon bee utterly againſt it, though cuſtom, though example, yet muſt we follow our direction, eſteeming the word as our pillar of the cloud by day, and our pillar of fire by night, to guide all our motions, while we are wandring in the wilderneſs of this world; and even till we attain the reſt which is prepared for the people of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But unto the Witneſſes choſen before of God,]</hi>

                     <p n="1">1 There was a Divine witneſſe of the Angels, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.6. <hi>Why ſeek yee the living among the dead? he is not here, but is riſen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, there was a real witneſſe of the Saints that roſe again with him and appeared to many, to the end, that they might teſtifie of his reſurrection, which we doubt not but they did, both by their appearing, and by word of mouth alſo.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there was a forced teſtimony of the Souldiers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.11. <hi>They came into the City, and told all things that were done:</hi> whoſe firſt report was a main proof of the truth of the thing, howſoever after they were hired to turn their tongues.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, there was the witneſſe of the Diſciples and followers of Chriſt: and this was either <hi>private</hi> or <hi>publick.</hi> The private witneſſe was of many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians, not only men, but women alſo who followed Chriſt, who alſo were by Chriſt vouchſafed to be the firſt preachers of it even unto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves; as wee read of <hi>Mary Magdalen, Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>Joſes, Salome, Joanna,</hi> and divers others. Such was the teſtimony of the two Diſciples who went between <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Emans,</hi> Luk. 24. to whom Chriſt made himſelf known the very day of his reſurrection, and yet were no Apoſtles. Thus were many other private Chriſtians undoubted witneſſes of the reſurrection, who no doubt ſaw and heard him in many of his apparitions, as well as the Apoſtles themſelves; in ſo much as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that hee was ſeen of <hi>more than five hundred brethren at once,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.6.

                     <p n="2">2 The Apoſtle in the words expreſſeth himſelf, by limiting them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; <hi>to us,</hi> namely, Apoſtles, <hi>who ate and drunk with him:</hi> not only who before his death lived as it were at bed and board with him, but after <hi>hee roſe from the dead,</hi> that we might not be deceived in our witneſſe of him.</p>

Again, herein hee honoureth alſo his inſtruments, who being in themſelves mean and contemptible, yet upon their calling received ſuch a portion of the Spirit, as that they drove the wiſeſt and moſt learned into admiration; and daunted the greateſt and moſt powerful, when they ſaw that no power or glory of this world, could draw or hinder them from the Execution of that Office, to which they were deputed.

                     <p n="4">4 By this choiſe of his, hee putteth a plain difference between his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the Kingdome of Antichriſt. His Kingdome upholdeth the truth of God, which is ſtrong of it ſelf, and well fenced by the power and ſtrength of God watching over it; and needeth not the arm of mans wiſdome, or humane power to lean upon: but if it get ſimple and plain men to carry it through the world, it diſperſeth it ſelf as the light: twelve naked and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men ſhall be enough to overcome all the power and wiſdome that the world can make againſt it.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 Note hence, in that our Lord Jeſus, would not only appear once, but very often, and not onely that, but eat and drink ſundry times, and this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the preſence of many authentical witneſſes;
<note place="margin">To beleeve the reſurrection, is an hard point.</note> 
                        <hi>what an hard thing it is to beleeve the reſurrection from the dead:</hi> yea, if wee ſhould hear it Preached from the bleſſed mouth of the Son of God himſelf. The Diſciples of Chriſt had often heard him, teaching them particularly of his reſurrection the third day; they had ſeen him accordingly riſen; yea, they had handled him with their hands: yet unleſs hee condeſcend to admit them as familiarly to eat and drink with him as before, they ſcarcely beleeve: neither can wee think the Diſciples flower of heart to beleeve than our ſelves are, who are ready to ſay in any thing that our eyes ſee not, with <hi>Mary, How can this be?</hi> But that neither they nor wee ſhould ſink down in this weakneſs, hee hath pleaſed to condeſcend to our infirmity, to remove all ſcruple from them and us, in this main article of our religion.</p>

For what is it that more confirmeth and ſtrengtheneth our Faith, than the boldneſſe and liberty of the Apoſtles, both in their Sermons and Writings? and whence is this but from their own full perſwaſion of the truth, which maketh them bold, and whence is this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, but from certain ſenſe and undoubted knowledge, ariſing from their familiar converſe with him after his reſurrection?</p>

To ſtrengthen this our weak Faith by this conſideration, conceive with thy ſelf that Chriſt ate and drunk with his Diſciples, that thy Faith might bee nouriſhed as well as others: and in that they ſaw him, heard him, handled him, ate and drunk with him, and being faithful witneſſes have Preached, and by writing avouched the ſame to all the world; thy Faith muſt bee as fully aſſured, as if thine own eyes had ſeen him, thine own hands handled him, and thy ſelf had ſit with him at the Table while hee ate and drunk among them: yea, ſo often as thou heareſt, or readeſt, or thinkeſt of any of theſe things; ſo often muſt thou bee renewing and adding ſomething to thy Faith in this behalf; as every new apparition or manifeſtation of Chriſt, added ſomething to the faith of his Apoſtles.</p>

                     <p>A Third argument to prove that Chriſt is raiſed from the dead, and ſo is indeed the true Meſſiah, and Lord of his Church, is, that he gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Commandement to his Apoſtles to become Preachers and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as of other points, ſo eſpecially of this; that howſoever hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to death, according to that judgement executed, and laid as one foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by death for the ſpace of three days, yet he is now gloriouſly raiſed again, and appointed of God the Judge of all that ever have lived, doe, or ſhall live to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>In the verſe we have three things to be handled.</p>

                     <p>In the firſt of theſe, are two branches to bee cleared. 1 <hi>That preaching is the ordinance of Christ.</hi> 2 <hi>The neceſſity, which will eaſily bee deduced from the former.</hi> That Chriſt inſtituted this holy ordinance, is plain, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Goe preach to all nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> the which commiſſion, that it was extended beyond their perſons, to ſuch as ſhould in after ages ſucceed them, appeareth by his laſt words, <hi>and behold, I am with you to the end of the world.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1 All thoſe external works are common to all the three perſons: and where any one of them are named in any action done without themſelves, no one of them is excluded, but all the three muſt be included.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Divinity of Chriſt is not obſcurely proved, in that the ſame glorious actions of the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, are aſcribed alſo unto him, as from Heaven whither he aſcended, to give ſeveral gifts for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.</p>

                        </gap>s.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But this ordinance of preaching, ſeemeth not to be Chriſts, becauſe it was long before his Incarnation; and now remaineth after his aſcenſion, when hee cannot call men as he called the Apoſtles while he was on earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Miniſtry of the Goſpel, in the proper acception of it, hath two things to be conſidered. Firſt, the <hi>being</hi> of it: Secondly, the <hi>vertue</hi> and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of it. The being of it (as it was the Miniſtery of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein glad tidings were publiſhed to all Nations) was temporary, beginning in the time of Chriſt, and ſhall have end with the world: yet can it
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40284:191"/> be called no new doctrin, becauſe the ſumme and ſubſtance of it, was (though more obſcurely) delivered to <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Fathers of the Old Teſtament. But if we conſider the vertue and efficacy of it, it is an <hi>eternal Gospel,</hi> Rev. 14.6. during from the beginning of the world to all eternity.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore will it not follow, that becauſe it was before his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was not his; but rather therefore it was his, who was before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, the chief Prophet of his Church, that raiſed, according to the ſeveral ages of his Church, ſuch men as were fit, either more obſcurely, as before his coming (when rather ſome Evangelical promiſes of things to come were preached, than the Goſpel it ſelf,) or elſe more manifeſtly to preach and open the myſteries of the Kingdom of God. And this latter kind of preaching, was not before his incarnation; neither was it fully ſetled before he aſcended into Heaven, and from thence gave gifts to men; that thereby hee might ſhew himſelf a careful Head and <hi>Governour</hi> of his Church, even then when hee was ſet down at the right hand of his Father. It is true indeed that before Chriſts ſuffering, he called his Apoſtles, inſtructed and furniſhed them with many gifts of the Spirit; yea, and theſe gifts were increaſed very much after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, whereby they were more confirmed in their Apoſtleſhip; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did before Chriſts death, exerciſe the office of Apoſtleſhip in <hi>Judea</hi> amongſt the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet had they not received that <hi>fulneſſe of the Spirit, and power from above,</hi> which was neceſſary to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, before they had received in the viſible form of fiery Tongues, the Spirit in abundant meaſure: whereby they were before all the people of the world, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort, ſolemnly inaugurated, and confirmed to bee the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt: neither had they, till after Chriſts reſurrection, received this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement (of which our Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>To preach to all Nations, and to every creature under heaven:</hi> the practice of which Commadement they took up after that (they having ſtayed at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the promiſe) the Spirit came upon them, and they were endued <hi>with power from on high,</hi> Luke 24.49.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond branch of the objection, that becauſe ordinary Paſtors and Teachers are not immediately called by Chriſt, being now in Heaven, therefore they are not ordained by him, it is falſe: for of the Paſtors and Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> it is ſaid, that the Holy Ghoſt <hi>made them over-ſeers:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth <hi>Apollos</hi> ordained by Chriſt as well as himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>What is</hi> Paul, <hi>and who is</hi> Apollos, <hi>but the Miniſters by whom yee beleeve?</hi> and, <hi>as the Lord gave to every man?</hi> only the difference muſt be obſerved in their calling both are called of Chriſt, but the Apoſtle by himſelf immediately, not by men: the ordinary Paſtor called of him by the Miniſtery of man. I call it a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, becauſe the whole power and authority of the Church in calling Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, is but a ſervice unto Chriſt; approving, declaring, and teſtifying to the Church thoſe whom Chriſt hath called. And therefore both before his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation a long time, and after his aſcenſion alſo, the exhortation which was enforced upon beleevers run in this tenor, <hi>to day if yee hear his voyce, harden not your hearts,</hi> Pſal. 95.7. Heb. 3.7. Whence we conclude, that <hi>his voyce</hi> hath ever ſounded in the Church, and ſo ſhall doe in the miniſtry of his ſervants, until his coming again to Judgement, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. hee that heareth them, heareth him; he that receiveth them, receiveth him; hee that refuſeth them, refuſeth him: he by his ſervants entreateth men to be reconciled; by them hee bindeth and looſeth, ſaveth and deſtroyeth.</p>

Let theſe men bethink themſelves, and then tell us whether the Holy Goſpel (being the power and arm of God to ſave every beleever, the glad tydings of ſalvation, and word of life) can make the World worſe than it is. For if that bee the uſe of it, our bleſſed Saviour was far overſeen to leave his glory of Heaven, to take our fleſh, and in it to ſubmit himſelf to the obedience of the whole Law; and to the ſuffering of the whole curſe of it, for our diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; if by all this hee leave the World, or make the World worſe than he found it. How ſhall it bee true that is written of him, that the <hi>Son of Man came not to deſtroy, but to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt,</hi> if the Preaching of him make the World worſe than it was? wee will eaſily grant that the Goſpel, being a great ſight, it daily diſcovereth that corruption and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which before lay hid; as the Sun riſing manifeſteth all thoſe things which were wrapped up in the darkneſs of the night.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 In powerful manner ſo to apply this Doctrin to every hearer, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may feel a change to follow, both in his heart and life. For to teach onely the Hiſtory of Chriſt his Doctrin, his Miracles, his Life, his Death, is not the full teaching of Chriſt: for thus the unbeleeving Jews know Chriſt; and the Infidel Turks can eaſily come to this knowledge of him. But to reach Chriſt as the <hi>truth is in Chriſt,</hi> is to apply every particular to the heart of a ſinner, that hee may bee framed to converſion and repentance; which is the moſt difficult labour of the Miniſtery, and moſt to bee ſtriven in. Many Teachers who can chooſe hard Texts, and make learned diſcourſes, and ſhew much dexterity of wit, reading, and humane literature, have not thus lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſt themſelves, not can after ſuch a lively manner teach him to others.</p>
                     <p>And pitty it is to ſee that whereas ſo great an Apoſtle as <hi>Paul,</hi> who wanted not Arts, Tongues, and humane Learning, deſired to know nothing but Chriſt, and him crucified, among the <hi>Corinths</hi> themſelves: it ſhould bee the ſtudy of many men to ſhew the knowledge of any thing rather than of Chriſt; and how they may paint out themſelves rather than Chriſt in their Preaching.

And this will not bee done but by the <hi>plainneſſe of words, and evidence of the Spirit.</hi> It is thought a reproach to preach a plain Sermon, whereas indeed, that is the beſt Sermon which teacheth Chriſt moſt plainly. 1 By true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture. 2 By wholeſome ſavory and proper Doctrin ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thered thence. 3 By ſound application of that Doctrin for the information

                     <p n="1">1 Becauſe this being the laſt work of Chriſt remaining to be done after his aſcenſion, it could not be ſo eaſily beleeved as thoſe things which were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And therefore hee would have his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles careful to help the weakneſs of mens faith, in the expectation of his return to judgement, by much and often beating upon it, as a point that needeth more inſtance and perſwaſion, than ſuch as (being paſt, and ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly confirmed by many hundreds and thouſands as they were) are far more eaſily apprehended, and beleeved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Scriptures teach that the remembrance of this judgement to come, is a notable means to quicken the godly in their duty, to work in them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent fear, and ſhake out ſecurity, which breedeth hardneſs of heart: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, conſidering the terrors of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.11. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke both himſelf and others unto their Duty: and no marvail, ſeeing the children of God, have even at the conſideration of more particular judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, been ſtricken with the fear of the Almighty. The Prophet <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk</hi> when hee heard but of judgements to come, ſaith, <hi>That his belly trembled, his lips ſhook, and rottenneſſe entered into his bones,</hi> Habak. 3.16. And <hi>David,</hi> being a noble King, hath theſe words, <hi>my fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements,</hi> Pſal. 119.120. A ſpecial example whereof, wee have in that famous Preacher of righteouſneſs, <hi>Noah,</hi> of whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. that being warned by God of the flood to come an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty years after, hee was moved with a reverent fear of God to make the Ark. And as <hi>Noah,</hi> was by hearing of the waters, ſo the ſervants of God hearing of fire, wherewith the world ſhall once again bee deſtroyed, ought to bee, and are moved with a reverent fear of God, which is as a ſteel ſpur to provoke them to their duty.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Scriptures make the contempt of this day of judgement, the ground of all ſins, and of the deſtruction of ungodly ones. For as it was in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo ſhall it bee in the day of the Son of man: they never dreamed of the judgement, before it came, and ſo periſhed in it; ſo men eat and drink, marry, and give in marriage, till the day come upon them as a ſnare, and they taken as a bird in an evil net. What was the cauſe that the evil Servant ſate him down with drunkards, and roſe up to beat his fellow-Servants, but becauſe hee ſaid with himſelf, my Maſter will ſtill defer his comming? In all which regards, neither the Apoſtles, nor wee the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Miniſters ſucceeding them, can want good reaſon to ſtir up our ſelves
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:40284:194"/> and others, by the often and diligent propounding and applying of this holy Doctrin of Chriſt his comming again to judgement.</p>
                     <p>The verſe containeth two things: 1 Chriſt his appointment to this office, <hi>that hee is ordained of God,</hi> 2 The execution of it, <hi>a Judge of the quick and dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the former, it will bee asked,

For all that power of judging which is in God by nature, ſhall bee in Chriſt as man by grace of perſonal union, for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
                     <p>Now the wiſdome of God thought fit in this manner,

                     <p n="1">1 Becauſe Chriſt having in his humanity accompliſhed the work of mans redemption, and in it had been judged in the world; it is meet that he ſhould now manifeſt the glory of his manhood, exalted above all creatures, and ſhining in ſuch brightneſs of glory, as is fit for ſuch a body as is united to the Divine nature.</p>
                     <p>Hence is it, that often wee read this ſecond comming oppoſed unto his former, wherein hee pleaſed to cover and veil his glory, which now he will reveal and diſplay above the ſhining of a world of Suns: Mat. 25.31. <hi>When the Son of man commeth in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then hee ſhall ſit upon the throne of his glory:</hi> Luk. 21.27. <hi>Then ſhall they ſee the Son of man come in a cloud with power and great glory.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Fourthly, That hee might in this laſt act of it, fully accompliſh his Kingly Office: for when hee ſhall have faithfully finiſhed this judgement, which is committed unto him, hee ſhall immediately <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Kingdome unto his Father,</hi> 1 Corinthians 15.24. not that hee ſhall then ceaſe to bee an everlaſting King of glory, but becauſe hee ſhall no longer exerciſe any temporary government as now hee doth. Hee
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:40284:195"/> ſhall not rule his Kingdome by Civil Magiſtrates, nor his Church by ſuch Officers, and miniſtery, as are now appointed under him for the gathering of the Saints. It ſhall not ſtand in need of the means of edification by the Word, Sacraments, or Cenſures; the Lamb himſelf ſhall bee all theſe in the midſt of the Throne of God. In both theſe regards, hee ſhall deliver up his Kingdome; but hee muſt firſt appear in a moſt glorious humanity to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this great buſineſs.

And the dead are mentioned as well as the living; becauſe the carnal and unbeleeving heart of man maketh more queſtion how thoſe who have been reſolved into duſt many thouſand years ago, can bee quickened and raiſed to judgement, than thoſe that ſhall bee found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live at that day: therefore is the Scripture very expreſs in this particular, Rev. 20.12. <hi>I ſaw the dead both great and ſmall ſtand before God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10. <hi>Wee

It is indeed a great honour among men to bee deputed the Lord high Steward under a King, whoſe office is to ſit in Judgement upon a noble man: what an height of glory then is it for the Son of God to ſit in Judgement, and call per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally before him, not nobles only, but all the Kings and Monarchs that ever the earth bare? If there be ſuch preparation, and ſtate amongſt men for
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:40284:196"/> the trial but of ſome one noble man: what glory may wee conceive muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the mighty God, whileſt he bringeth to their trial, not only meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but all the moſt powerful Monarches and Potentates that ever were, or ſhall be, to the end of the world?</p>
                     <p>This conſideration miniſtreth comfort to the godly, ſeeing hee cometh to Judgement, who is able perfectly to free them from all miſery; able to ſtrike oft their bolts of ſin, to acquit them from terrours of conſcience, fears of death, the Grave, the Devil, and Hell it ſelf the cometh from Heaven for their releaſe, who hath <hi>trodden down all his enemies under his feet:</hi> and all this glory is for their ſafety and happineſſe, who wiſh and <hi>wait for the appearing of this mighty God,</hi> Tit. 2.13. And on the contrary, it ſerveth to ſtrike the wicked and ungodly with terror and dread, ſeeing the Lord Jeſus ſhall come from Heaven in ſuch power and majeſty, and all to judge and condemn them: whom when they ſhall ſee arrayed with vengeance againſt them, no marvail if they be driven to their wits ends: yea, as it is with guilty Malefactors, when they ſee the Judge coming in ſo honourably attended, ſo ſhall it bee here; this very glory of Chriſt ſhall ſtrike them with fear, horror, and an azedneſſe, and force them to all miſerable, and unavaylable ſhifts; and to wiſh, if it were poſſible, that the rocks would fall upon them, and cruſh them to peeces, ſo as they might never come before his preſence: for the great day of the Lord, which is to all the wicked of the world a black day, a cloudy day, a diſmal day, this day is come, and they cannot abide it.</p>

Let this Doctrin abate ſomewhat the pleaſure of ſin, which moſt men ſwallow up ſo delightfully, yea and glory in their iniquity when they can carry it ſo cloſe and clear away, that men ſee it not, and can ſtopp the cry of their ſcared conſcience for the preſent: but remember, that God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it up, and the time haſteneth when that conſcience of thine, now in a dead ſleep, and ſcared up, ſhall bee awakened, and become as a thouſand witneſſes againſt thee, that if all other accuſers ſhould fail, thy ſelf ſhould not fail to do that office againſt thy ſelf; but ſhalt bee both a ſervant to Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as alſo the ſubject of it.

                     <p>The ſecond thing that hindereth this expectation of the laſt Judgement, as carefully to be avoyded as the former, are the cares of this preſent life, and the greedy deſire and thirſt after the world, which by this conſideration alſo may be abated.

Tell me now whether thou wouldſt not then eſteem Chriſt and his merit thy chiefeſt commodity: or if thou couldſt but conceive with thy ſelf the truth, and ſay to thy ſoul I ſhall certainly ſhortly come to anſwer the Judge of all the world; c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, in truth men live generally as though there were no Judgement to come, or as though they had ſtricken a covenant with it to paſſe over them: for when we preach, and men hear or read of the Judgement to come, who trembleth at it, as <hi>Felix</hi> an Heathen did, to hear <hi>Paul</hi> diſpute of it? When we teach that the Judge is at the door, who ſeeth all the facts of men, and draw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wee like <hi>Lot</hi> fore-warn men of the evil to come; but men, like <hi>Lots</hi> couſins and kinſmen, entertain our words as a jeſt: we are as though we mocked; and ſo they ſit out the ſummons to their further danger: yea more than this, when the Lord thruſteth his fearful judgements into the eyes and ſences of men, as fore-runners of this general; men ſhut their eyes, and will not ſee the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them; nor the danger of ſin by them; nor the ſpecial an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God bewraying it ſelf and broken out in them; but ſtill live as they did in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> and will lay none of theſe things to heart, till it bee too late.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, in <hi>arraigning</hi> our ſelves before Gods Judgement Seat; that is, when by ſerious conſideration we ſummon our ſelves before this Judge to whom we are to be countable. This is the <hi>memento</hi> that <hi>Salomon</hi> giveth the young man who is ſet upon his pleaſure, <hi>Remember that for all this thou muſt come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And if the young man muſt ſawce his pleaſures with this remembrance, much more the older had need, as being in the ordinary courſe of nature nearer it than they: ſome of the ancients have ſo acquainted and accuſtomed their hearts to this meditation, that one of them profeſſeth of himſelf that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he was, or whatſoever he was doing, he thought he heard always this voyce in his ears, <hi>Ariſe yee dead, and come unto judgement.</hi>

                     <p>Job <hi>knew that his Redeemer lived, and that he ſhould ſee him at laſt on the earth.

If they ſay the Churches teſtimony is a Divine teſtimony: I anſwer, ſo far as it carrieth with it the agreement of the Scriptures, and Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking therein, it may bee ſaid to witneſſe a Divine truth. And thus in no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect can the voice of the Church bee called a divine teſtimony, than the preaching and writing of ſome other teacher in the Church, who delivereth nothing but what is agreeable to the Scriptures. From this ground it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is wicked and derogatory to the Glory and Majeſty of the Scriptures, in that they ſtifly after conviction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch and maintain, that the authority of the Scriptures, depend upon the teſtimony of the Church, ſome of them blaſphemouſly ſaying, that they have no more credit than <hi>Eſops</hi> Fables, further than the Church giveth it unto them: which is to ſay, that God muſt not bee beleeved for himſelf: and as if the Kings word ſhould have no credit or command, but from his guard.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Popiſh doctrin teacheth not true faith to this day.</note> From which deſcription of true juſtifying faith, it is evident that Popish Doctrin knoweth not, teacheth not, nor ſuffereth men to be taught the true Doctrin of ſaving faith, becauſe it utterly diſclaimeth the very eſſential form of it, which is ſpecial application of Chriſt and his merits, with affiance and reſting only on them unto ſalvation; yea and more, they condemn this glorious work of faith as a mortal ſin, and ſtile it by the name of preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſo, by Gods juſt judgement, they take up ſuch a faith in ſtead of it, as is common, not only to Hereticks and Reprobates, but to the very Devils themſelves, who beleeve as much as Popiſh doctrin requireth to ſalvation, yea and more, they tremble alſo. For doe not they know and aſſent that there is one God; that all that is in the Word of God is true and certain; that all the Articles of the Creed are the true grounds of Chriſtian religion? and if you goe any further (excepting the thruſting in of general Councils and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which every good Catholick muſt take in with the former) Popiſh faith leaveth you, and biddeth you farewell: and even thoſe things which are abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation to bee beleeved by ſaving faith (as that the Scriptures are Gods Word, that the Articles of faith compriſed in the Creed of the Apoſtles are of undoubted truth) they embrace only by Hiſtorical faith; by which yet was never man ſaved: for if ever man were, then might the Devils alſo by the ſame faith. But juſtifying faith is another manner of thing; it ſeateth not it ſelf in the underſtanding only, as the former, but take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the whole ſoul, even the heart, will, and affections alſo, all which lay hold and cleave unto Chriſt for ſalvation. Neither is it a common and general work of the Spirit upon good and bad, as the former illumination and aſſent is; but a ſpecial favour and extraordinary grace proper to the elect, as wee have heard, and the ſtranger entreth not into this their joy.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond point to be conſidered, is the benefit or excellent fruit of this grace.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="393" facs="tcp:40284:203"/>1 It is the firſt ſtone to be laid in the building of a Chriſtian,
<note place="margin">Five excellent fruits of ſaving faith.</note> and therefore called a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>foundation,</hi> Heb. 11.1. and the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>rooted,</hi> and <hi>built,</hi> and <hi>ſtabliſhed in the faith,</hi> Coloſ. 2.7. this is that rocky foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which ſhall bear up the houſe againſt all winds and weathers. It is the firſt work of change in the heart, and the firſt difference between man and man, when God <hi>by faith purifieth the heart,</hi> Acts 15. It is the foundation of all obedience; for whatſoevee <hi>is not of faith, is ſin.</hi> It is the root of all Gods worſhip; for till we beleeve in God, we can neither truſt, nor hope, nor love, nor pray, nor perform any other part of his ſervice truly or acceptably. It is the mother of all good works: the word is the ſeed of them, which faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth and digeſteth, and ſo bringeth forth commanded and commended actions. General faith knoweth the work to bee good in the kind of it, and ſpecial juſtifying faith beginneth it, and maketh it good in the perſon, and endeavour of the doer; and layeth hold upon Chriſt to cover the defects of it. Hence is it, that often in the Scriptures we read it to bee the firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, to ſuch as were deſirous to know the way of life, and how they might pleaſe God. The Jews come to our Saviour, and ask him, what they might doe to <hi>work the works of God?</hi> and Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning here, telleth them, that <hi>this is the work of God, that they beleeve in him whom he hath ſent,</hi> Joh. 6.28, 29. And, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we beleeve in the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another:</hi> for we cannot perform any work of love before we beleeve. In one word, faith is the very ſoul of all obedience, without which, the moſt fightly and glorious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be it of alms, prayer, preaching, hearing, worſhip, or miracles themſelves, all are but very Corpſes and Carcaſes of good works, dead and liveleſs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, faith exalteth it ſelf above all other graces, not only in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent object of it, which is Chriſt and Salvation; but alſo in the excellent work of it above them all, notwithſtanding they all have their ſpecial excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies: it eſpouſeth us unto Jeſus Chriſt, and in theſe eſpouſals and contract for the preſent, it aſſureth us of our marriage with him hereafter. And being the <hi>condition of the New Covenant of life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. it tyeth God himſelf unto us; who is not further bound to any man, than he is a beleever. True it is, that <hi>Love</hi> placeth it ſelf upon Chriſt, but it is after faith: for hee muſt bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended before he be loved. <hi>Hope</hi> waiteth for ſalvation: but faith firſt belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it. <hi>Truſt</hi> leaneth upon the promiſes: but faith firſt layeth hold on Chriſt the Author and accompliſher of them. And though the Apoſtle ſay, that of <hi>Faith, Hope, and Love, Love is the chiefeſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. himſelf interpreteth it to be in reſpect of durance and continuance, but not in reſpect of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or acceptation with God. Love indeed ſurviveth and laſteth longeſt; for our ſight of God as he is ſhall vaniſh faith; but yet faith is before it, and the mother of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſaving faith is a living thing, and maketh a man to live by it: It purgeth his own dwelling by purifying the heart and conſcience, it reneweth the ſpirit and mind, it quickneth to all good duties: for it being an inſtrument to unite unto Chriſt, by it, as by a bond of union, wee receive from him our Head, life, and power to move and ſtirre in Chriſtian duties: yea, it ſo gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the whole life, that we henceforth live not, but Chriſt liveth in us. In our buſineſs and labour, it maketh men diligent in the work, but leave the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to God. In temporal wants, it faith with <hi>Abraham, God will provide,</hi> at leaſt <hi>in the mountain:</hi> it careth not ſo much for bread, as the ſtaff of it: if it have means, it bleſſeth God, and uſeth them; but truſteth not in them: if it have them not, it reſteth on God, but uſeth no unlawful courſes for them. In af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions it ſtabliſheth the heart with aſſurance of a good iſſue, and ſtill waiteth the Lords leaſure without making haſte. In temptations it goeth againſt ſence and feeling, and reſteth upon the naked promiſe: yea, when it can ſcarce ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

Thus is faith every where diffuſed; if we walk, <hi>we walk by faith:</hi> if we live, we <hi>live by faith in the Son of God:</hi> if we ſtand, <hi>we stand by faith:</hi> if we dye, <hi>we muſt dye in faith,</hi> as the Patriarks did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.</p>

In finding this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the Chriſtian cannot hide his joy; neither can any mans joy bee ſo full, unleſſe hee with others <hi>rejoyce together.</hi> For it is not here as in earthly things, which the more they are communicated, the more are they diminiſhed, and every mans ſhare is the leſs; but heavenly things are by communication
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:40284:206"/> the more increaſed; for wee read not of any man that laid out his Tallent, but to increaſe? and as the light of the Sun is never a whit impaired by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it ſelf to the whole world; or as hee that lighteth one candle of another, dimiſheth not in either, but increaſeth the light; ſo is it in the light of the Sun of Righteouſneſſe much more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the kindling of theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſparkles, whoſe property is to diffuſe themſelves as fire, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſpread, the greater and brighter is the flame.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The third fruit or effect of Faith, is an undaunted confeſſion of it: Rom. 10.10. <hi>With the heart wee beleeve to juſtification, and with the mouth we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to ſalvation.</hi> For where faith is in the heart, it will bee alſo in the mouth. The ſpirit of Faith, and the ſpeech of Faith are undivided: as 2 Cor. 4.13. <hi>And becauſe wee have the ſame ſpirit of Faith, according to that which was written:</hi> I beleeved, and therefore I ſpake, <hi>even ſo wee beleeve,</hi> and therefore alſo wee ſpeak. Now there bee three actions of Faith which help forward this free confeſſion. 1 It maketh a man bold in a good cauſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.29. <hi>Peter</hi> being full of faith, with a bold ſpirit told the Council that had the power of Life and Death in their hands, and himſelf in their power, <hi>wee ought rather to obey God than you.</hi> 2 Faith keepeth a man in a preparedneſs to ſuffer by leading him along in the denial of himſelf; and hereof wee have a notable example in <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 21.13. who profeſſed how <hi>ready</hi> hee was, <hi>not onely to bee bound, but to dye alſo at Jeruſalem,</hi> if God called him thereunto. 3 It worketh joy, yea, much rejoycing in the heart, in the ſuffering for Chriſt and a good cauſe: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. after the Apoſtle had laid down the juſtification of faith as a ground, hee ſaith, that <hi>wee then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in tribulation:</hi> and that they did ſo indeed is plain, Act. 5.41. <hi>They departed from the Council, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke for his name:</hi> hence could they ſing <hi>Pſalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> at mid-night in the dungeon, and fetters: and hence could the Martyrs imbrace the fire, kiſs the ſtake, and teſtify ſuch joy in the flames, as all men might acknowledge the truth of the ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>Your joy ſhall no man take away from you;</hi> no Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, no tormentor, nor any kind of torment.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and laſt fruit or work of faith is, that whereſoever ſound faith is, it is moſt diligent in preſerving, yea, and increaſing of it ſelf. The moſt covetous man is not more complaining nor gathering than the beleever, who is ever complaining of want of Faith, or of the weakneſſe of it; <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24. and knowing the want of it to bee ſo dangerous and hurtful, as without which hee wanteth Chriſt himſelf: as alſo that the weakneſſe of it depriveth him of much comfort and many goods things; for a man of weak eſtate muſt needs want many rich commoditys and ſweet comforts which the wealthy enjoy in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Therefore hee uſeth all good means to increaſe his ſtock: as,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Hee is much in hearing, reading, and meditating in the word, becauſe he knoweth,
<note place="margin">Means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſtock of faith.</note> 
                        <hi>faith commeth by hearing:</hi> and every thing is preſerved and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that whereof it is begotten.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hee is much in godly talk and Chriſtian conference, by which as the fire by the bellows, ſo is the grace of God blown, and ſtirred up in him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Becauſe hee ſeeth how without prayer, both his own, but eſpecially Chriſts, his faith is as ready to fail as <hi>Peters</hi> was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32. hee is much in prayer, and with the Father of the Childe, cryeth with tears often, <hi>Lord, I beleeve, help my unbeleef,</hi> Mark. 9.24. and with the Diſciples, <hi>Lord increaſe our Faith,</hi> Luke 17.5. And theſe are the marks by which the ſoundneſs and currence of Faith; as by a touchſtone may bee tryed, and diſtinguiſhed from all that falſe and counterfeit Faith which is ſo ſtiring in the World, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by moſt men are lamentably deceived.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of this Doctrin is, 1 To ſtir up men to examine, and by theſe notes to prove themſelves, whether they are in the Faith or no, to try their
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:40284:206"/> faith of what kinde it is, leaſt in the end they find that they have leaned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtaffe of reed. By which examination, I fear it will bee too evidently ſeen, that theſe are the laſt daies wherein the Sonne of man ſhall come, and ſcarcely find faith upon the face of the earth. Sure it is, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith of men is neither thus, 1 Founded, 2 Nor qualified,
<note place="margin">The moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith of men is not thus qualified.</note> 3 Nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. 4 Nor thus fruitful: as will briefly appear in the particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Every man ſaith he hath Faith; but whence had hee it: it was never begotten by the Word; he never cared for that, that was ever as a ſixt finger and ſuperfluity unto him. It was never founded in repentance, nor dwelleth with Humility; for moſt men never ſaw change in themſelves, they have loved God and beleeved in Chriſt ever ſince they can remember. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cheriſhed with the duties of prayer and invocation, they could never pray in all their lives except after the Miniſter, or by ſet forms, but the ſpirit of prayer never dwelt there. It was never conflicted with unbeleef: they wonder what that ſhould bee, or that any man ſhould not ever beleeve: ſo as indeed here is no character of the faith of the Elect; and nothing all this while but a voice, and very carkaſe of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Others ſay they beleeve, and brag of a ſaving faith in Chriſt, but they feed a bare fancy: for they could never beleeve God for leſſer things: they want the faith of Gods providence even for meat and drink, which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in that they can uſe wicked and unwarrantable means for them: their ſtrong faith they brag of, waiteth not for Gods proviſion, but will ſhift for it ſelf by hook and by crook: it holdeth not the heart to patient bearing of the Croſs, but flingeth out in diſtempers: it putteth not forth in inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our buſineſſes, to give directions to the particular actions of life: and therefore ſeeing this faith faileth in leſſer and ſmaller things, how can it bee ſound in the greateſt of all?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Others boaſt of a ſound faith, which were it ſo, it would lay hold upon the promiſe, and beleeve for themſelves and their ſeed; but this it doth not: for many who for themſelves would reſt in the providence of God, upon the good and warrantable m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>s, will yet indanger themſelves for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And hence is it that many who have lived conſcionably in ſingle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, have remitted much of their care and fear in their married conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and come ſhort of their former uprightneſſe; and why is this elſe, but that they conceive not the Lord to bee <hi>all ſufficient</hi> for them and theirs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Others there bee that challenge as ſound a faith as any, but never priſe ſuch a pearl as it is: can a man have ſuch a commodity, but hee ſhall value it according to the worth? but theſe think themſelves never the richer for it: they have more ſence and joy in the ſmalleſt, and moſt trifling earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profit, then that Chriſt is become their gain, which although they profeſs, yet this undervaluing of him in their hearts, giveth their tongues the lye. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it they did eſteem of faith indeed, they would profeſs it boldly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it to all the World, whereas they are aſhamed of Chriſt before men, and caſt themſelves into the night with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> as fearing leſt if they ſhould come to Chriſt by day, men would ſee them, whoſe praiſe they love above the praiſe of God: and whoſe reproach they fear above the rebuke of the Almighty. But how unlike is this to the faith of the Saints, whereby they could eſteem the <hi>rebukes of Chriſt, above the treaſures of</hi> Egypt. And further, were it ſo they made reckoning of their faith, they would much more care for the end of it; for ſound faith carrieth the heart even in the conſtant wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wiſhing for Chriſts appearance; but theſe rather fear it than hope it. Now what a faith is that which never careth to come to the end of it, that fain would ſtill bee pitching upon earth, ſaying with <hi>Peter</hi> when hee wiſt not what hee ſaid, <hi>It is good being here.</hi> Is this Faith an evidence of <hi>things
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:40284:207"/> not ſeen?</hi> or doth it <hi>look at things within the veil?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5 Another ſort would be loath to be otherwiſe accounted, but true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and yet their faith worketh no change in them; how their hearts are purified, witneſſe the uncleanneſſe, envie, drunkenneſſe, oathes, injuſtice, covetouſneſſe, contempt of the Miniſtery, prophanations of the Sabbaths of God in themſelves and theirs: theſe and the like proceed from within; and by the Waies in the ſhop any man may know how the Warehouſe is ſtored. And as this faith purgeth not the naſty corners of the heart, no more doth it the mouth, but that venteth according to the abundant foulneſſe of the heart, and is filled with unclean, unſavoury, or unfruitful ſpeeches. Further, as they were at firſt enemies to God, and goodneſſe; ſo they abide ſtill, and are no changelings. Here is no faith working by love; neither to <hi>God;</hi> for they will doe nothing for him, will be at no coſts or pains for him: and as little will they ſuffer for his ſake, not a reproachful word; much leſſe will they rejoyce in ſuffering: neither to <hi>Gods</hi> children, theſe can they pinch and diſgrace, where as l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for helping others to Heaven, they are ſo farre from it, as that if any will caſt an eye that way, they can tell what he is preſently, and they would be loath to be ſuch an hypocrite, or preciſe tool as he is.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, although true faith is moſt induſtrious in the means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and increaſing it ſelf, theſe men hold their wont: enemies to the Word were they, and ſo are they ſtill, they neglect the means, and abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Miniſtry; and can no more beleeve than <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when Chriſt came and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel propoundeth promiſ s of life and ſalvation, but they truſt God no further than they ſee him; they rejoyce no more in them than they can in another mans mony or evidences; they pray not to be taught of God, nor hear to bee increaſed in faith; nor meditate nor conferre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And indeed, this is the ſum or epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of all Gods mercy, in which the Lord <hi>crowneth</hi> his Saints with compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; a mercy which <hi>reacheth up to heaven,</hi> and draweth them out of the moſt miſerable thing in all the world; which is to lye under the curſe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſin, and conſequently, under the endleſſe diſpleaſure of the Almighty. Which point being even as the one thing neceſſary to be known and attained. I will ſtand a little longer upon it, hoping to ſpend my time well in ſetting down theſe five points. 1 The neceſſity of remiſſion of ſins. 2 The benefits of it. 3 The Letters of it. 4 The helpes to it. 5 The companions of it, by which as by ſo many notes we may know we have it: and ſo we will adde the uſe of the whole doctrin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1 Neceſſity of remiſſion of ſins in three points.</note> Firſt, the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it will appear, if wee conſider, 1 The multitude and abundance of our ſins, which are to bee remitted, being for number as our hairs, and as the ſand of the Sea which is numberleſſe; which cannot bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeeing <hi>we drink in ſin</hi> as the Fiſh doth water, <hi>Job</hi> 15.16. that is, inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the Fiſh ceaſing to drink in water, ceaſeth to live; neither can we ceaſe to ſin, till we ceaſe to live. Nay, ſeeing our very beſt actions hold no corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the Law of God; and in ſtrict juſtice are no better than ſo many ſins: this conſideration exceedingly multiplieth our ſins; in that not only in fayling in, but in doing of our duties wee ſin inceſſantly againſt our God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If we look upon the danger of ſin, we ſhall better ſee the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. It is a filthy Leproſie which infecteth the body and ſoul, the thoughts, ſpeeches, and actions: it maketh a man a loathſome creature in the eyes of God; it maketh God our enemy, who is the fountain of life, and whoſe lightſome countenance is better than life: yea, it maketh God depart from his Creature, and deſtroy the works of his own fingers: it layeth the ſinner open and naked to all the wrath of God, to all the Curſes of the Law in this life, and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:40284:210"/> in the life to come. It ſetteth him as a butt againſt whom the Lord in anger ſhooteth out of his quiver all the arrows of his diſpleaſure. It is the only thing which unremitted, maketh the ſinner abſolutely unhappy, and every way moſt accurſed. Neither doth the whole heap of ſin only make the ſinner ſo miſerable, but any one ſin even the leaſt unpardoned, would for ever hold the ſinner under perdition. And more, all the men that ever were or ſhall be in the world, were never able to riſe from under the burthen of one ſin, if it were imputed unto them: and yet the moſt of the world ſee no part of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſin, and therefore no ſuch neceſſity of the remiſſion of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Conſider thy own inſufficiency, if thou hadſt the ſtrength and power of all men and Angels, to ſatisfie for the leaſt ſin: and if we: cannot ſatisfie for any, what remaineth but a fearful perdition from the Lord, and from the glory of his power, if all be not remitted. In one word, the ſinner who hath not got his diſcharge ſealed, is without all ſafety in his life, all ſound comfort in his death, and at the Judgement Day, ſhall have the ſentence of everlaſting torment with the Devil and his Angels awarded him, before men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond point, is the <hi>benefits</hi> iſſuing from it, and theſe are:
<note place="margin">Benefits flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin four.</note> 1 <hi>Peace of conſcience,</hi> an immediat fruit of our juſtification by faith, and reconciliation with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God:</hi> and it was ordinary with our Saviour to joyn them together, as <hi>Luk</hi> 7.47. <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven thee, goe in peace.</hi> This benefit the moſt know not what it mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but he that hath the feeling of the wrath of God againſt his ſin; and ſeeth nothing but an angry face of God burning like a conſuming fire; hee that is ſo ſtraitned as hee can think no other thing but that the Lord in his juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath caſt him quite away: this man, as of all other torments that can be ſuffered in the world he lyeth under the greateſt, ſo nothing in the earth can content or comfort him, but only the ſence, and perſwaſion of Gods favour. Now the conditions of peace with his God, are the moſt joyful tidings in all the world, as is the unexpected news of a Pardon to a Malefactor ready to execution for high Treaſon againſt his Prince.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The <hi>right and poſſeſsion alſo of life everlaſting:</hi> For if wee bee eſtated unto life eternal by our juſtification and righteouſneſſe before God; then are we ſo alſo by remiſſion of ſins; becauſe theſe two are confounded in the Scriptures, and are the ſame. Whence it is that the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7. being to prove the point of juſtification of a ſinner before God, without the works of the Law, citeth the text, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further, If our whole redemption put us in poſſeſſion of everlaſting happineſſe; ſo doth alſo remiſſion of ſin, ſeeing the Apoſtle in ſundry places confoundeth theſe two, and expoundeth one by the other, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>By whom we have redemption through his bloud, even the forgiveneſſe of our ſins,</hi> Col. 1.14. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his bloud, that is, the forgiveneſſe of ſins.</hi> And it muſt needs follow, that if they <hi>who are juſtified, and ſanctified, are alſo glorified,</hi> then they have attained the beginnings of their glory, who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The benefit of Chriſts interceſſion, which meriteth all our good; for hee <hi>prayeth not for the world, but thoſe that are given him out of the world,</hi> Joh. 17.19. and this is no ſmall benefit, ſeeing no part in the prayer of Chriſt, no part in his death: he will not endure death for him for whom he will not vouchſafe to pray.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Conſolation in affliction, ſtrength in temptations, and aſſured com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in life and death, are the ſweet fruits ariſing from remiſſion of ſin. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Although afflictions entred with death into the world by ſin, and in their
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:40284:211"/> nature are teſtimonies of Gods wrath; yet ſin being remitted, they proceed no further from God, as a juſt Judge revenging ſin, but from a merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either for trial of us and our graces, or for chaſtiſement, to keep us from periſhing with the world; to make us hate ſin the more, to draw us nearer him in invocation and prayer, to force our affections out of this preſent world, to fray others from ſin by our example, to conform us to the image of his Son, and to ſhew his mighty power in our weakneſſe, by turning them to our beſt. And thus from the former conſideration ariſeth to the beleever even in darkneſſe a great light.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <note place="margin">Satans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions foyled by this aſſurance.</note> 2 From hence obtaineth the beleever notable ſtrength and ſence againſt the fiery darts of Satans temptations. For Satan urgeth the poor ſinner ſundry ways, as 1 By the multitude and vileneſſe of his ſins, with which his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence telleth him he is covered: and thence inferreth, that becauſe the wages of every ſin is death, and becauſe he hath deſerved eternal death, he muſt needs periſh, he can expect no other. But now can the beleever ſtop his mouth, and ſay, I grant Satan all thy premiſes; no ſinner is worthy of, or can expect ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in or by himſelf or ſo long as he continueth in ſin: but my ſins are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by means of Chriſts ſatisfaction; and though in my ſelf I am worthy to periſh, yet in Chriſt I have a worthineſſe to bring me to ſalvation. I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue not in my ſinful eſtate, but am drawn out of the guiltineſſe, the filthineſſe, the ſervice, the love and liking of my ſins, through the grace wherein I ſtand: and therefore thy conſequent is falſe, I fear it not being ſo forceleſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 From the Juſtice of God, who cannot but reject whatſoever and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not fully conformable to his righteouſneſſe: but here the beleeving heart is quieted, in that through remiſſion of ſins, the Juſtice of God is fully ſatisfied, though not by the perſon offending, yet in his pledge and ſurety Jeſus Chriſt, who being <hi>juſt,</hi> dyed for the <hi>un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ust,</hi> that we might be the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God in him. And hence the juſtice of God is a matter of moſt comfort to the poor ſinner, in that this righteouſneſſe cannot ſuffer him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſatisfaction twice for one and the ſame ſin; for this directly fighteth with juſtice and equity.</p>
                     <p>And if Satan be ſtill inſtant, and ſay, But what ſhall anothers righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe avail thee, if thy ſelf bee not a keeper of the Law? <hi>for the ſoul that ſinneth, that ſoul ſhall dye:</hi> the beleeving heart will readily anſwer:</p>
                     <p>That although the Law require proper and perſonal obedience, yet the Goſpel tranſlateth it to the perſon of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Surety, who being God and man, not only paid the whole debt, but performed all righteouſneſſe, abſolutely fulfilling the whole Law: whence it is that his obedience is called the <hi>fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Law for righteouſneſſe to every one that beleeveth,</hi> Rom. 10.4. and himſelf was made under the Law, that hee might redeem from it thoſe that were under it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the Tempter will alleadge, But for all thy righteouſneſſe thou haſt innumerable ſins, original and actual, which the Lord hateth, and every day addeſt to the huge heap of them; The heart which holdeth this article of remiſſion of ſins, abideth undaunted: for though it feel a body of ſin dwelling with it, yet is it not reigning ſin, it is not ſin at quiet, but daily battail is maintained againſt it; it is ſin weakned, and in daily conſumption; and therefore ſhall never be laid to the charge of him that is in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Jeſus Chriſt: for the law of the ſpirit of life which was in Jeſus Chriſt hath freed me</hi> (though not from all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation and preſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet) <hi>from the Law,</hi> that is the ſervice and ſlavery <hi>of ſin and of death,</hi> verſ. 2. But numbers (will he ſay) who make account to partake in the death and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, are damned, and have no benefit by it: and numbers have revolted and fallen away, and why maiſt not thou? to which the beleever will readily anſwer, that thoſe that were thus plucked up,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:40284:211"/> were never of the Fathers planting; only infidels and unbeleevers have fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and withered for want of rooting and moyſture; but I beleeve the remiſſion of ſins, not by any ungrounded perſwaſion, but with a ſound, laſting, and unfayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, reſting it ſelf wholly upon Chriſt; ſo as <hi>I am perſwaded neither death nor life can ſeparate me from his love,</hi> the work of whoſe ſpirit maketh me bold to call upon God as my tender Father; and produceth the fruits of true faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion into my whole life, whereby I know as infallibly the truth of my faith, as I know the preſence of the Sun by his light, or of Fire by his heat. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he that hath begun to make mee good, will make mee alſo perſevere in goodneſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 This aſſurance of remiſſion of ſins, yeeldeth moſt aſſured comfort in life,
<note place="margin">The ſound comfort of this article.</note> and in death: the goodneſſe of <hi>Pauls</hi> conſcience, was his comfort when hee ſtood at the barre, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, even the teſtimony of our conſcience:</hi> and in the agony of death, this is the Chriſtians comfort, that his ſin being remitted, the ſting of death is gone; the locks of this ſtrong <hi>Sampſon</hi> wherein his great ſtrength ſay, are clipped off, and hee is diſarmed of his weapons which are our own ſins. So as a Chriſtian may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him into the field, and ſay, <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi> which becauſe he is bereaved of, when he intendeth to kill, he cureth; when hee doth his worſt, which is to ſeparate ſoul and body, he can ſever neither from Chriſt; nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſendeth the member of Chriſt, and ſetteth him nearer to his head, <hi>which is best of all.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1 An erroneous judgement, that no man can attain certainly to beleeve the pardon of his ſins: for the common Proteſtant is a very Papiſt in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who hold that to doubt of this point is a vertue, and to beleeve it, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, becauſe no man can certainly know it without a ſpecial revelation: ſo ask ordinary Chriſtians, doe yee beleeve the pardon of your ſins, they will ſay yea, for God is merciful, and they be not ſo many or great but they may be pardoned.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By his minde is there meant his ſecret will: but his minde revealed wee may, and muſt; a part of which is, that whoſoever beleeveth in his Name ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins: which general promiſe while we ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially apply to our ſelves, the Spirit begetteth this aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>but wee are commanded ſtill to fear, Bleſſed is hee that feareth alwaies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Wee muſt not fear the mercy of God concerning ſalvation, but carry a reverent fear in regard of Gods judgements. 2 Wee are to fear in regard of our ſelves, and ſins, by which wee deſerve the judgements of God as well as others; but this is not contrary to aſſurance of forgiveneſs of ſins; for mercy is with <hi>thee that thou maiest bee feared:</hi> which the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet would never have ſaid, it fear could not ſtand with aſſurance of mercy. 3 Such a fear is commanded as may ſhake our ſecurity, but not to drive away the boldneſſe of Faith: a fear of falling into ſin, not a falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from grace: a fear leſt wee offend a merciful God, but not leſt he take away his mercy from us.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond <hi>Let,</hi> is the want of judgement to diſcern aright of the beſt things, and of reſolution to purchaſe or practice that which a truely infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med judgement concludeth to bee the beſt. This was the ſin taxed in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> who ſaw not the greateſt good neer her, as <hi>Mary</hi> did. And the world is full of <hi>Marthaes,</hi> who willingly hurried with many earthly diſtractions, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglect the one thing neceſſary; namely, their Reconciliation with God, and the things which ſerve to uphold and maintain the Chriſtian life, whereby Chriſt ſhould live in them, and they in him.</p>
                     <p>What elſe is it that maketh men run over Sea and Land to provide for the body and bodily life, and in the mean time caſt off all the care, and means of the knowledge of God, and conſcience of their waies, but that they ſee no profit in ſerving God? they taſte a little ſweetneſs of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but not of the Creator himſelf; a ſmall peice of earth hath more ſavour to them, than the God of Heaven. This is it that cauſeth men to walk painfully all the week in their perſonal and particular Calling, but all the week and Sabbath too neglect the general Calling of a Chriſtian: whereas had they any judgement in the things of God, reaſon would teach them that the particular muſt yeeld to the general, as the inferiour give place to the ſuperiour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Learn to eſteem every thing in the meaſure and degree of its goodneſs.</note> Yea, this is it which ſtrongly forceth men to chooſe the profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this life, which altogether croſs and hinder this chief and principal care of gaining the favour of God; becauſe they do not follow the rules of wiſdome, which eſteemeth of things according to their degree and meaſure of goodneſſe, and not above. Which if men would give themſelves to bee ruled by, they would with the Saints of God in this compariſon, account but meanly of the things in the higheſt account with earthly minded men. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> comparing his gain of Chriſt with the gain of the World, hee eſteemed this as loſs, yea as dung, which indeed is the right eſtimate of it in this compariſon.</p>
                     <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> would rather bee a door-keeper where Gods face may ſhine upon him, than enjoy the honours and pleaſures of the World in the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Princes without it. <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, the wiſeſt and wealthieſt of all men, after good tryal, pronounced of all earthly indowments, abſtracted from the fear and favour of God, that they were vanity and vexation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and determineth this to bee the ſum of all, to fear God, and keep his Commandements. Thus are the wiſe mans <hi>eyes in his head,</hi> and his heart is
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:40284:212"/> at his <hi>right hand, Eccl.</hi> 2. both for deliberating and executing of things moſt neceſſary to bee done; whereas the heart of the fool is at his left hand, he doth all as it were with a left hand for want of this judgement.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Third</hi> and main <hi>Let,</hi> are frivolous and fleſhly conceits which dead and quench any ſuch motions as otherwiſe might provoke men to this care of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins. As</p>
                     <p n="1">1 What need I bee ſo fooliſh, and preciſe, I have lived well hitherto without all this adoe; if God loved mee not, he would never have bleſſed me as he hath done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> But look to thy ſelf who thus reaſoneſt;
<note place="margin">Say not God loveth thee unleſs thou have ſuch ſure grounds as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> It is not enough to ſay God loveth mee; but to have ſure evidence of it, yea, ſurer evidences than any thou yet ſpeakeſt of, I mean common and outward bleſſings; which like the Sun, or the rain are generally diſpoſed to the good and bad; <hi>and by which no man can know love or hatred,</hi> Eccl. 9.</p>
                     <p>Again, Gods love goeth with Election, Juſtification, Sanctification, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Calling, Faith, Love, Hope, Patience, Repentance, Mortification. Examine thy ſelf by theſe notes: for if God love thee as his Child, thou lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt him, and keepeſt his Commandements; thou loveſt not ſin, but hateſt it, even thy deareſt ſins, and preſerveſt a care to pleaſe him in all things: Joh. 14.23. <hi>If any man love mee, hee will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Whereas they ſay that others which nouriſh this care, are as much croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as any other, and therefore they ſee no reaſon that they ſhould make their Life ſo uncomfortable to no purpoſe: let them know, that all the croſſes Gods Children, whoſe care is to make up their peace with God,

And 6 If the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bee ſo ſtrawed with Croſſes, what is the way to Hell: If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the wicked and ſinner appear?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Whereas they object further againſt this care, that men of good note, and perhaps Preachers too, account it but fantaſtical, and more than needs; and onely a few, and thoſe deſpiſed ones in the World, do thus diſquiet themſelves, who make their lives more uncomfortable than they need.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, this is indeed one of Satans greateſt holds,
<note place="margin">Better going to heaven alone, then to Hell with company.</note> but ſuch a ſnare as God leadeth his Children out of in ſafety: whom hee teacheth that it is their happineſſe to go to Heaven, though alone, rather than to Hell with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. <hi>Mary</hi> will ſit her down, though alone, at Chriſts feet, if ſhee cannot get her ſiſters company: ſhee knoweth it is the good part that ſhall never bee taken from her. And for thoſe (eſpecially if they bee Miniſters, who ſhould moſt advance this care) but diſgrace it as a needleſſe vexation of the Spirit, let them know, that the Lord Jeſus was of another minde, who pronounced bleſſedneſſe on thoſe that <hi>mourn now,</hi> and promiſed that they ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: and far are they from the guidance of that ſpirit who hath taught us, that of all Sacrifices none is comparable to that of a broken ſpirit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart which the Lord never diſpiſeth.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Now follow the <hi>helps</hi> to the obtaining of remiſſion of ſins. As,

A poor fellon on the gallows ready to bee turned off would think a pardon the welcomeſt thing in all the World: but the hardneſs and drowſineſs of mens hearts, every where argue that they bee a very few that find this rare grace, unleſſe wee will ſay that the greateſt bleſſedneſs that living man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, can be given to him that ſleepeth on both ſides, that never thinketh of it, and never maketh means after it.</p>

Oh how wilfully herein doe men forſake their own mercy, how careleſly doe they caſt out of their hands, the only comfort of their life and death?</p>
                     <p>Whoſoever therefore thou art that haſt hitherto deſpiſed ſo great ſalvation, that haſt ſet light by Gods gracious invitings to repentance, and that haſt frowardly rejected his kindeſt offers of mercy, now at length begin to take up ſhame in thy face, and ſorrow into thy heart: in earneſt accuſe the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thy ſoul, the deadneſſe of thy ſpirit, the hardneſſe of thy heart, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe of thy whole life: ſay with thy ſelf, Ah my folly, that have neglected my mercy ſo long: alas, how have I hated inſtruction? how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly have I dealt with ſo loving and patient a God: I ſee now that it is high time to look to the main buſineſſe of my life, to make up my peace with God, to get my pardon ſealed: I will live me to the Throne of Grace. I will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth lay hold of eternal life: I ſee now that there is one thing neceſſary, and that is the good part which I will chuſe, and which ſhall never bee taken from me.</p>
                     <p>Now we come to the ſecond point propounded (which is the laſt of this worthy Sermon) namely, what is the condition of every one that hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this excellent grace of remiſſion of ſins:
<note place="margin">Whoſoever hath attained remiſſion of his ſins is an happy man.</note> and that is to bee a bleſſed and happy man: for ſuch a one hath part in Chriſt, and with him of forgiveneſſe of ſins; in which <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 32.1. placeth bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how can this man be a bleſſed man, ſeeing hee is compaſſed with a body of ſin and death, and ſubject unto infinite afflictions, than whom no man is in this life more miſerable, no ſort of men more perplexed inwardly with ſence of ſin, none more outwardly diſgraced for well-doing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There be three degrees of bleſſedneſſe. 1 In this life,
<note place="margin">Degrees of bleſſedneſſe.</note> when God bringeth his children into the kingdom of grace, and giveth them his Son, and with him their whole juſtification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſanctification in part. 2 The ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is in the end of this life: when God brings the ſouls of the faithful to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and their bodies to the earth, ſafely to be kept until the laſt day. 3 The third in and after the Day of Judgement, when he bringeth both ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the glory prepared for the elect: Of this laſt which is <hi>happineſſe</hi> by way of eminency, the two former are certain fore-runners, and hee that hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the firſt, hath alſo aſſurance of the laſt, and muſt needs bee a bleſſed man, not only in time to come, but even for the preſent, whether wee reſpect his outward eſtate or inward.</p>
                     <p>For his <hi>outward</hi> eſtate, Gods bleſſing never faileth him, but affordeth him all good things, and that in due ſeaſon, and in due meaſure: his riches are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not great, but ever precious: and his little ſhall nouriſh him, and make him as well liking as the water and pulſe did the Jewiſh children in <hi>Chaldea.</hi> The ſame providence which watcheth to ſupply all his good, keepeth him from all evil; it pitcheth the Angels round about him to guard his life; let him be perſecuted, he is not forſaken; his loſſes become his gain; his ſickneſs is his phiſick; his heart is cheared even in trouble, which maketh that part of his life comfortable; his ſoul is bound up in the bundle of life with God; death ſhall not come before hee can bid it heartily welcome: yea, let violent death come, it ſhall not be to him deadly: ſlain he may be, but not overcome: victory attendeth him, and bleſſedneſſe every where abideth him.</p>
                     <p>But all this is the leaſt part of his bleſſedneſſe: for if we look yet a little more inwardly into him, we ſhall ſee the boundleſſe extent of his happineſſe farre more large: whether we reſpect the ſpiritual miſery hee hath eſcaped; or elſe the ſpiritual good which with the pardon of his ſins hee hath attained: for on the one hand, he hath eſcaped the heavie wrath of God due to ſin; and ſo is diſcharged of an infinite debt, healed of a moſt deadly poyſon, and pardoned
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:40284:215"/> from a fearful ſentence of eternal death and perdition ready to bee executed upon him: and on the other, hee hath obtained a plentiful redemption; hee hath purchaſed the pearl, received Chriſt with his merits and graces; ſuch as are Wiſdome, Faith, Hope: whence iſſue our peace, and joy of heart which is Heaven before heaven (for in theſe ſtand the Kingdome of God) and the comfort of a good conſcience, which is a continual feaſt. By all which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that hee is no ſmall gainer that hath got his part in Gods mercy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the remiſſion of his ſins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Open thine eyes and ſee the happineſs of the Saints.</note> 
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1 Wee are here admoniſhed to open our eyes that wee may more clearly ſee and grow in love with the felicity of the Saints, which the moſt ſee not, becauſe 1 It is inward; the glory of the Spouſe is like her Head and Husbands glory, ſhee is all <hi>glorious within.</hi> 2 Becauſe of their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and frailties, which wicked eyes altogether gaze upon. 3 Becauſe of their Afflictions wherewith they are continually exerciſed. If the Tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fall on any of them, they are thenceforth greater ſinners than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men: holy <hi>Job,</hi> becauſe hee was afflicted, cannot avoid the note of an Hypocrite, even among his own Friends and Viſiters. And no marvail if the members look thus black when the Sun looketh upon them; ſeeing their Head Chriſt himſelf was rejected, becauſe they ſaw and <hi>judged him to bee plagued and ſmitten of God,</hi> Iſa. 53.4. But wee muſt look beyond all theſe, as the Lord himſelf doth, who in his judgement goeth beyond the out-ſide, and pronounceth ſentence according to the grace which himſelf worketh within.</p>
                     <p>Let us imitate our Lord Jeſus, who notwithſtanding all the infirmities, yea and deformities of his Church, pronounceth of her, that ſhee is all fair, and no ſpot is in her, not becauſe there are none, but, becauſe all are covered, and none are reckoned and imputed unto her: yea, let us remember that the pure and holy Spirit of God is contented, notwithſtanding much blackneſs, to take up his lodging in thoſe hearts where hee findeth reigning ſin diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. Now how far are they from the mind and judgement of this bleſſed Father, Son, and Spirit, who have nimble eyes to ſpy out every infirmity of Gods Children to blaze them; nay, rather than they will not accuſe and ſlander them, can of themſelves coin, raiſe up, and impute unto them that, whereof they are moſt innocent? Aſſuredly theſe are of neer kindred to the Devil, who is the accuſer of the brethren.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The glory of God in his children turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſhame.</note> And ſurely were Chriſt on earth again, even this moſt innocent Lamb of God ſhould not want accuſers, wherein are ſo many of <hi>Cains</hi> conſtitution, who hate their brethren, becauſe their works are good; and ſo many Sons of men, who ſeek to turn the glory of God in his Children into ſhame. Alas, religion is at a low ebbe already, and not ſo reckoned of as it ſhould bee by the forwardeſt, and yet ſo malitious is the Devil in his inſtruments, as unleſs this ſmoaking flax alſo bee quenched, wee can ſee nor hear of any hope or treaty of peace: the beauty of Gods people goeth diſgraced under titles of niceneſs, preciſeneſs, purity, holy brotherhood, and the like.

                  <p>You were then dear to our common Mother, that famous Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which for your Eloquence and grace of ſpeech and perſwaſion, appointed you her Orator: for your wiſdome and gravity in government, choſe you her Proctor: for your ſoundneſſe in all kinde of fruitful and commendable literature, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred you all her honours and degrees: and for your ſober, ſtudious, and vertuous converſation, worth ly held now her great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Neither is this <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection</hi> any ſuch policy and warineſs in matters of Religion, as relingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth any good duty to which it hath calling, or any practice of holineſs, for outward profits and commodity, or to preſerve outward peace and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as many crafty and deceitful Proteſtants, that are ſo circumſpect, as they will profeſs a Religion which ſhall coſt them nothing. Neither is this <hi>Circumſpection</hi> in any thing contrary, or croſs to that dove-like ſimplicity and Chriſtian innocency,
<note place="margin">What it is</note> which is the ornament of holy profeſſion. But is a carefull <hi>and exact proceeding in the ways of God, according to the rules of God:</hi> even as a work-man moſt exactly fitteth his work by the level and rule, and departs not from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">And in what.</note> Now to this <hi>Circumſpection</hi> are four things required:</p>

                        <note place="margin">To circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect walking four things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> 1. A knowledge of the right way, which is as the <hi>light,</hi> guiding him to ſet every foot ſafely. For let a man be never ſo circumſpect and wary, if he be in the night without a light, and without a guide, he can never walk ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely and ſafe. <hi>The Word is the Lanthorn,</hi> and <hi>the Commandement is the light.</hi> And <hi>when wiſdom enters into the heart, and knowledge delighteth the ſoul, then ſhall counſel preſerve thee, and understanding ſhall keep thee, and deliver thee from the evil way,</hi> Prov. 2.11, 12.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A diligent watch and <hi>care</hi> to keep from all extremities, to turn neither to the right hand, nor to the left. For it is hard to keep a mean, we being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry propenſe to extreams. Satan cares not ſo he can conquer us, whether it be by curioſity or by careleſneſs; whether he can keep us out of the Church, or caſt us out by our own conceits; whether he can keep us ſo cold, as no good thing greatly affects us, or whether he can make us boil over with unbridled zeal, that becauſe we cannot have all the good we would, we will refuſe a great deal of good we might have. A <hi>Circumſpect</hi> Chriſtian will diſtinguiſh good from evil, and not refuſe good for evil, for that is an extremity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 An holy <hi>jealouſie</hi> and <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> leſt the heart be deceived through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.

As he that is very circumſpect for the World, is moſt ſuſpicious of others, leſt they over-reach and beguile him: So one that is moſt circumſpect for heaven, doth more ſuſpect himſelf than any other.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 A <hi>Provident Walking,</hi> by which a man is able to foreſee future danger and evils to prevent them, and provide for ſuch things as may beſt beſtead him in the way.

                     <p>Which is injoyned us in ſundry other places of ſcripture, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be ordered aright.</hi> Matth. 10.16. <hi>Be wiſe as Serpents:</hi> This Serpentine wiſdom is nothing elſe but Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Circumſpection.</hi> Heb. 12.13. <hi>Make right ſteps unto your feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>THe Apoſtle here expoundeth what he meaneth by <hi>circumſpect walking,</hi> namely, a wiſe ordering of a mans ſelf according to the rules of Chriſtian Prudence. For wiſdom is two-fold, either Worldly and Carnal, or elſe Heavenly and Spiritual.</p>
                     <p>This diſtinction is the Holy Ghoſts own, in <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.15, 17. where both of them are at large deſcribed.
<note place="margin">True wiſdom, what it is.</note> Our Text ſpeaketh of ſpiritual and heavenly wiſdom, which is ſuch a gift of God, as both directeth and effecteth, or cauſeth a man to do that which is acceptable and pleaſing unto God.

Hence the holy Ghoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where calls fooliſh men to give <hi>ear to underſtanding, and to hear the words of Wiſdome,</hi> Prov. 8.5, 6. and verſe 33. <hi>Hear inſtruction, and be wiſe.</hi> Neither muſt we hear till we get a ſmattering knowledge of ſome general grounds of Religion, in which moſt reſt themſelves; but to <hi>underſtand the whole will of God,</hi> which is our rule; and not onely to underſtand it,

This is the high priviledge of the Scripture above all writings, that theſe alone <hi>are able to make men wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15.

And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why many hear a long time, and are never the wiſer, is, becauſe they never care to faſten it by meditation, and make it their own; <hi>but wiſe men will lay up knowledge,</hi> Prov. 10.14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A loving and thankfull imbracing of admonition and rebuke,
<note place="margin">3. Embracing of admonition.</note> 
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8, 9. <hi>Rebuke a wiſe man, and he will love thee; give admonition to the wiſe, and he will be the wiſer; teach a righteous man, and he will increaſe in learning: But rebuke a Scorner, and he will hate thee,</hi> and <hi>fools ſcorn admonition.</hi> And therefore we are commanded not to ſpeak <hi>in the ears of a fool, for he deſpiſeth the wiſdome of our words,</hi> Prov. 23.9. The way for a man to grow wiſe, is, daily to diſcover his own folly, and make uſe of their words, who would help him in this buſineſs. Thus <hi>David</hi> grew ſenſibly wiſer by the reproof of <hi>Nathan,</hi> when he made him confeſs he had done very fooliſhly.

                     <p n="5">5. Be fervent in prayer; It is a ſpiritual wiſdome, and a gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; therefore <hi>if any man lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God,</hi> Jam. 1.5. It is wiſdome from above, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. This wiſdome is not the birth and iſſue of great wits, and quick conceits, but is ſeated in the heart that is humble, and in ſanctified ſouls, that are familiar with God, and frequent in prayer. For as <hi>Moſes</hi> when he was long in the Mount with God, his face ſhined when he came down; So thoſe that continue in the Mount of Divine Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and petitions, ſhall ſhine in wiſdome and knowledge. How, or whence
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:40284:225"/> got <hi>Solomon</hi> all that meaſure of Wiſdome (in which hee was an eminent Type of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in whom were hid treaſures of Wiſdome</hi>) but becauſe hee asked it of God as his chief choiſe? And <hi>David</hi> in the 119. <hi>Pſalm</hi> makes no end of begging wiſdome, underſtanding, good judgement from God; becauſe hee knew there was the Fountain.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the means that are ſet apart by God, for the attaining of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. If wee fail in them, let us blame ourſelves, if folly eat us up.</p>

For the object of our joy muſt not bee carnal, but the Lord himſelf, apprehending him, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>El ſhaddi,</hi> All-mighty to ſave, All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupply, and a large portion, our Sun, our Shield, Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 84. <hi>Solomon</hi> having tried his heart with all other delights, came at laſt to a recantation; and ſo do all Gods children, and ſay, <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us,</hi> Pſalm 4.</p>

A wiſe man will not inſiſt in the gift, but look to the giver, whoſe love hee prizeth more than the token of it.

                     <p n="3">3 Let us labour to get our affections more to Heaven than earth,

A wiſe man ſhould rather chuſe Hell than <hi>Gods</hi> offence; for there is nothing but ſin which <hi>God</hi> hateth; and wee ought to hate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much; ſin directly reſiſteth Gods glory, but puniſhment makes for it in the manifeſtation of his juſtice.</p>

For by idle and inordinate living, through the neglect of the Vocation, by Gods juſt judgement men fall into the depth of ſin, Drunkenneſs, Gaming, Whoredome, Theeving, and nothing comes amiſs to an idle perſon.

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Rules of Wiſdome concerning a mans eſtate, and first for adverſity.</head>
                     <p>THe rules of Wiſdome concerning a Chriſtian mans eſtate, are theſe:
<note place="margin">One general Rule for all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, is to think the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate beſt for thee.</note> Firſt, General. Secondly, Special.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>general</hi> rule for all eſtates, is this: Bee prepared for any eſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in every eſtate, and aſſure thy ſelf the preſent eſtate (whatſoever it is) is beſt for thee, though not ever in thy ſenſe, yet in Gods gracious and wiſe ordering of it. This leſſon the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had well learned, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>I can want, and abound, I can bee full, and hungry: I have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all eſtates to bee contented.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſpecial</hi> rules are either for proſperity, or for adverſity.
<note place="margin">Rules for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> Concerning adverſity and afflictions, theſe are the rules of Chriſtian wiſdome:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Conſider thou art not placed here in the world by God,
<note place="margin">1 God may as well be injoyed in Adverſity as Proſperity.</note> to injoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the World, but to injoy God, which thou mayeſt do as well in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction as in proſperity, and to cleave to him in his ſervice, looking for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but afflictions, as a Pilgrim going to thy Country, the way whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, lyeth through afflictions. This ground not laid, men count troubles a ſtrange thing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. and ſtart at the mention of them, as the Apoſtles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.8. when they heard Chriſt ſpeaking of going into <hi>Jury,</hi> where the <hi>Jews</hi> had lately ſought to ſtone him. And note it to bee a corruption of the heart, to bee more grieved for thine own troubles, than the troubles of the Church, for private, than publick evils.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Lay up ſtrength and comforts aforehand; As firſt, Humility,
<note place="margin">2 Lay up ſtrength and comfort afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</note> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter and tame the pride and rebellion of our hearts, and to bring in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs to ſweeten our troubles, and our labour will be well ſpent; for if wee can reliſh the hardeſt part of our life, our whole life elſe will aſſuredly bee more ſweet and joyful. 2 Grow up in the knowledge of God, which will make thee riſe up in much comfort, and will bring in comfort againſt that confuſed heavineſs, diſtruſt, and dangerous affections and paſſions, which elſe in trouble might beat us down, and off him. 3 Get aſſurance of faith, which will ſweetly warm the heart in the ſenſe of Gods love in Jeſus Chriſt; The fruit of which will bee, firſt, To inable us to truſt our ſelves with God in any eſtate, and bee aſſured the Lord is with us in fire and water, <hi>in the midſt of the Valley of the ſhadow of Death.</hi> Secondly, to depend on him for ſtrength;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 23.4.</note> for howſoever Satan would make us beleeve our affliction is greater than it is, or wee are for it; yet wee ſhall aſſure our hearts that the Lord hath mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured it out for our ſtrength, and <hi>not above.</hi> Thridly,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note> to wait upon him for a good iſſue and ſeaſonable deliverance, who hath promiſed to turn it <hi>to the beſt.</hi> This ſhall keep us from fainting, diſtruſt, and deſpair.
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 In all evils of puniſhment, take occaſion to ſet upon the evil of ſin,
<note place="margin">3 In evils of puniſhment to ſet upon evil of ſin.</note> and revenge upon that; complain of it to God and men, murmure and grudge at nothing elſe. If affliction bee ſharper than ordinary, it is ſure ſome ſin or luſt addes a ſting unto it. But this rule mortifies ſin and unruly paſſions, and will weaken the heart, and make a man ſay with the Church,
<note place="margin">Mic. 7.9.</note> 
                        <hi>I will bear the wrath of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned.</hi>

God ſometimes layes on a little finger, and the froward heart lays on the whole hand and loyns, to make the burden heavier with faithleſs heavineſs and diſtruſt, which is but an addition of new and worſe troubles than the former. How inconſiderately do many men load themſelves with troubles too too light in themſelves, and on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of wiſe men, who can make a vertue of neceſsity, and ſtep over a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:40284:229"/> of rubs, which others ſtoop to remove, and infinitely toil themſelves? How do many in ſmaller troubles, as diſcourteſie of neighbours, unrulineſs of children, unfaithfulneſs of ſervants, ſmaller loſſes and croſſes in Family-matters, give place to unquietneſs, impatience, and paſſion, till their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have (by ſeeking to caſe their burden) increaſed it from a dram to a talent? And now how unmeet are they for the ſervice of God? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable in any Chriſtian ſociety? How ſowr and heavy in countenance, diſguiſed in ſpeech,
<note place="margin">Levius ſit pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionus Quicquid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigere eſt noſas. Horat.</note> and impotent in their behaviour? All which teſtifie the frowardneſs of the heart, wherein had there been a dram of Chriſtian wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and moderation, the paſsion had not ſwelled to the cauſe, much leſs ſo far exceeded it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Make not haſte from under any affliction; <hi>Hee that beleeves, makes not haſte:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">5 Make not too much haſte from under them.

Gold is not preſently pulled out of the fire ſo ſoon as it is caſt in, but muſt ſtay a while till it bee purged.

                     <p n="1">1. COncerning the ground of them: Labour to get a good heart,
<note place="margin">Rules for ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. 1 Let words iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue from a good fountain. Matth. 5.18.</note> 
                        <hi>For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will ſpeak. The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely,</hi> Prov. 16.23. And, if the <hi>heart indite a good matter, the Tongue will be the Pen of a ready Writer,</hi> Pſal. 45.1. Such as the heart is, ſuch will bee the ſpeech: And therefore hee that hath no care of his heart, cannot bee a good and careful ſpeaker. The Apoſtle requires <hi>gracious ſpeech,</hi> Col. 4.6. but that muſt come from a gracious heart, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37.30, 31. <hi>The mouth of the righteous will ſpeak of wiſdome, and his tongue will talk of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For the Law of his God is in his heart, and his ſteps ſhall not ſlide.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.26. <hi>Shee openeth her mouth with Wiſdome, and the Law of Grace is in her tongue.</hi> On the contrary, a graceleſs heart cannot ſpeak well, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20, 21. <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth; the lips of the righteous do feed many; but fools ſhall die for want of Wiſdome.</hi> The true reaſon why many mend not their bad ſpeeches, is, becauſe firſt they mend not their heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Concerning the matter of ſpeech;
<note place="margin">Let the matter be choiſe.</note> 1 Becauſe all muſt be wholeſome ſo much as wee may, therefore chuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:40284:230"/> neighbours,
<note place="margin">If it concern God, what.</note> or our ſelves. 1 If it concern God, or any part of his Name, Attributes, Word, or Works, wee muſt ſpeak moſt reverently, as thoſe who are not worthy to take his Name into our mouths. The precept is, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Thou ſhalt not defile the Name of the Lord, but fear his glorious Name,</hi> Deut. 28.58. And they defile his Name, who in common talk, lightly, and careleſly uſe his Name, of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> or any other of his titles, in ordinary ſpeech: And they, who are ordinary or idle ſwearers, and curſers, and jeſters in Scripture-phraſes, who are far from <hi>trembling at his word,</hi> Iſa. 66.3. and thoſe that mock at ſin and Gods judgements, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe or are unthankful for any of his mercies.
<note place="margin">2 If our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> 2 If the matter of thy ſpeech concern thy brothers perſon, the rule is, to ſpeak of the good thou knoweſt by him, behinde his back; but of evil, not without calling, nor without grief, and before him, or to him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2. Warn them that they <hi>ſpeak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of no man, but bee ſoft, and ſhewing all meekneſs to all men.</hi> Contrary whereunto is ſcoffing, deriding, curſing, railing, bitter and ſlanderous ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, tending to the offence of any man; yea, if mens ſpeeches may juſtly offend us, wee muſt bee ſoft and calm, ſhewing all meekneſs, not rendring rebuke for rebuke, but paſſing by his ſin, eſpy in his perſon the image of God worthy to bee reverenced and loved. If thou ſpeak of his ſaying<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.7.</note> Praiſe God for his good actions; and as for ſins in him, deal plainly and truly with him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother, but ſhalt plainly rebuke him, and not ſuffer his ſin upon him.</hi> Wee muſt not lye, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, flatter, or ſooth up any in their ſins, which is a moſt ordinary ſin againſt this rule of Wiſdome.
<note place="margin">3 If our ſelves.</note> 3 If the matter of thy ſpeech concern thy ſelf, ſpeak modeſtly, without vanity or boaſting, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.2. <hi>Let another man praiſe thee, and not thine own lips.</hi> Nay, wee ſhould rather extenuate and leſſen the good in us, if wee muſt needs ſpeak of it, as <hi>Paul, I am the leaſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;</hi>

                        </gap>e our time in impertinent things. The maſter that ſent his ſervants into the Vineyard, ſent them in to work. Do we think that God ſent man into the World to ſport and play for his recreation ſake, or idleneſs, yea, or to eat and drink, and onely to get what to maintain himſelf by? No, but for ſomething beyond all theſe; elſe his end were not beyond the brute-beaſts. Or can wee think that God hath given men gifts of reaſon, underſtanding, judgement, and means of nature and grace, for the culture of all theſe, onely to enjoy outward things, to feed their pleaſure and appetite, which they might fully injoy without all their gifts? No, but the maſter gave his ſervants talents to traffick withall, to make their Lord and themſelves gainers. Wee muſt therefore acknowledge ſome thing to bee abſolutely neceſſary, unto which all other things are neceſſary but reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and carry our ſelves unto every thing accordingly. If wee would know what that is, which is abſolutely neceſsary, our Saviour tells us,
<note place="margin">Luke 10.42.</note> 
                        <hi>One thing is neceſsary,</hi> namely, to know how a man may come into Gods favour and bee ſaved; and all earthly things are reſpectively neceſſarie, ſo far as they conduce to this. To know the vertue of Chriſts death and reſurrection, is abſolutely neceſſary; all things are to bee counted but droſs and dung unto this, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                     <p>But in all neceſſary actions,

The truth hereof appears, becauſe a man may do what God commands, and omit and forbear a work prohibited, and yet ſin in both: For example, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtides</hi> practiſed juſtice moſt ſtrictly, yet herein hee ſinned, becauſe it was no work of faith. <hi>Alexander</hi> conquering <hi>Darius</hi> violated not the chaſtity of <hi>Darius</hi> his wife and daughters, but forbare this prohibited and ſinful acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet therein hee ſinned, becauſe hee forbare not of good conſcience. But wee muſt know, that this ſin lyeth not in the ſubſtance or matter of the work, which is materially good, but in the vice of the doer, and manner or end of doing: Neither are theſe ſins in themſelves but onely by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

                        </gap>: Life is not ſo neceſſary, as without ſeparation to cleave to that which is good. In ſpiritual things to preach the word is ſo neceſſary,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.26.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> cries, <hi>Wo</hi> unto himſelf if hee do not, becauſe the flock of God depends upon him: But if I may not preach, unleſs I wound my conſcience, by compounding with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and blending truth with errour; I muſt never preach, but leave the care of the Church to God, who without my lie, will provide for the good of it. Thus <hi>Elijah</hi> fled and left his Miniſtry, becauſe hee could not exerciſe it, unleſs hee would have received <hi>Baals</hi> ceremonies, and flattered with the <hi>Baalites:</hi> And if hee had not thus forſaken his place, hee had forſaken the Church. Great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> chuſed rather to leave his Church, than to yeeld any thing to the <hi>Arrians.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 20.29.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> knew, that after hee went from <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, grievous Wolves would come in, not ſparing the flock:</hi> And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee could not ſtay to preach, unleſs hee would have reſtored ſome phariſaical obſervations; and unleſs for peace ſake, hee would have yeeld<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d to the rites and image of <hi>Diana,</hi> he left the place, becauſe he muſt not do the greateſt good by any evil meanes. Never let any think to thrive, by means which God hath accurſed, and upon which himſelf cannot pray for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">For the order of the two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> All neceſſary actions muſt bee done according to the order of the Tables, ever eſteeming the duties of the firſt Table, more neceſſary than they of the ſecond. This is Chriſts own rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.38. <hi>This is the first and great Commandement,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Duties of the firſt table muſt bee done firſt.</note> 
                        <hi>and the ſecond is like to this,</hi> both in reſpect of the neceſſary binding, and of the end; for even theſe are a worſhip of God, if they bee performed in faith, and for his commandement ſake. Wherefore elſe did the Lord deliver two Tables, whereas hee might have put all into one, but that hee would prefer and claim the firſt place to duties that immediately concern his worſhip? From whence Divines gather that rule of Antinomy and truth, that when the two Tables are oppoſed, and both call for neceſſary duties, which both cannot bee done at the ſame time, the ſecond Table muſt give place to the firſt, as <hi>Act.</hi> 5.25. <hi>It is meet to obey God rather than man.</hi> Magiſtrates muſt bee obeyed; but the firſt Table derogates from the ſecond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when both cannot bee obſerved. So in the New Teſtament, Parents and
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:40284:234"/> friends are to bee loved; but if they bee not hated for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when both cannot bee loved together, one cannot bee Chriſts Diſciple.</p>
                     <p>But here bee three Caveats:
<note place="margin">Three caveats.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 That a ſpecial commandement is more neceſſary, and diſpenſeth with all the Ten: And it is a principle, that all commandements of both tables run with one exception, <hi>If God command not otherwiſe, Thou ſhall not kill, nor ſteal,</hi> unleſs God command <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his ſon, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to rob the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gyptians. Thou ſhalt make no graven image,</hi> unleſs God command <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to make a Brazen Serpent. Thus obſervations of immediate commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments give all Sovereignty to God, who is to bee ſimply obeyed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged above his Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Moral duties muſt take place of all ceremonies: The rule of Divines is, that charity diſpenſeth with ceremony, according to that,
<note place="margin">Matth. 12.7.</note> 
                        <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice,</hi> becauſe mercy is moral, and ſacrifice ceremonial. So <hi>Abimelech</hi> gave <hi>David</hi> the Shew-bread, which was not lawful, but in the caſe of neceſſary mercy. And it was ſuperſtition in the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that they would rather ſuffer their City to bee taken,
<note place="margin">Matth. 12.11.</note> than fight upon the Sabbath day in their own defence. God allows <hi>an Oxe to bee pulled</hi> out of a ditch,
<note place="margin">Exod 12.16.</note> and led to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and allows a <hi>neceſſary</hi> proviſion for the body, unto which even Sabbath duties muſt give place.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Neceſſity (wee ſay) hath no law, but that is to bee underſtood in mans laws, when ſome ſudden caſe falleth out, ſo as the inferiour cannot have recourſe to the Law-maker, that then hee may interpret the law him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and break the letter of it, to follow the reaſon and intent of it; as in caſe of the murder of a thief. But in the Law of God, one onely caſe doth diſpenſe with it, and that is when neceſſity ſo altereth a fact, as it taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it all reaſon of ſinning: As for example; it is not lawful to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones ſiſter, but in the beginning of the world extreme neceſſity altered this fact, and gave diſpenſation. So it is not lawful to take away that which is anothers but extreme neceſsity makes it lawful, becauſe it is not anothers any longer, ſeeing the Law of nature it ſelf maketh ſome things common in ſuch extream neceſsity. On the Sabbath wee muſt hold our ſelves ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Gods worſhip, but if an houſe bee on fire, wee may leave it without ſin. Note the equity of that Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.24, 25.</p>

                        <p>I remember the ſtory of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who being invited to a place, where a notable Harlot was to bee preſent, asked counſel of <hi>Menedemus</hi> what hee ſhould do: Hee bad him onely remember that hee was a Kings Son.</p>
                        <p>Good men may bee invited where none of the beſt may meet them; the beſt counſel is, to keep in minde that they bee Kings Sons, Gods Children; and a baſe thing it were to bee allured from their profeſſion, by the ungodly. 3 To conſider in our eating and drinking our own end, and mingle our feaſting with a meditation of death: As <hi>Joſeph</hi> had his Tomb in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to ſeaſon his delight with meditation of his end. Alas, this feeding and feaſting, is but a little repair of a ruinous houſe which muſt go down.

Muſt I eat and drink to riſe up to play? No, I muſt beſtir mee in ſuch duties, wherein I may expreſs much love, for much love.</p>

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:40284:238"/> ſports, as Playes and Interludes, which are the repreſentations of vices not to bee named among Chriſtians; beſides mens wearing of womens apparel, the incentives of luſt, and fewellers of fleſhly flames. Heathen Law-givers have baniſhed ſuch out of their Countries. 3 Mixed dancing of men and women together, never read of in Scripture with approbation, and here in our Text noted to bee the fruit of Idolatry, Riot, Drinking, and all other diſſolute behaviour. Would God, the root, and tree, and all branches laden with ſuch fruit, were quite ſtubbed up. The Heathens themſelves condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it:
<note place="margin">Nemo niſi aut ebrius aut infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus tripudlat.</note> It was an ordinary ſpeech among the <hi>Romans,</hi> None but either a Drunkard, or a mad man danceth. It were too long to infer the ſentences of the Heathen. The general conſent of Fathers, and the determinations of Councils made againſt this wicked and laſcivious practice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Baſil</hi> in a Sermon of his concerning Drunkenneſs, ſaith, God made our knees not to caper like Goats, but to bow to the worſhip of God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Viret.</hi> on the ſeventh Commandement, <hi>Chorca in circulo, centrum dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus, circumferentia ejus Angels.</hi> Therefore let the Sons of Light deteſt ſuch an unfruitful work of darkneſs; For what is there here but luſt of the fleſh, and luſt of the eyes? What is here elſe, but carrying fire in the boſome, and walking upon coals, and how can a man avoii burning? This practice agrees neither with the gravity of the man, nor the ſhamefaſtneſs of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; nay, the very ſight of it in a woman, is known more to overwhelm a man than ſtrong drink, as wee may ſee in <hi>Herod,</hi> Mar. 6.22.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Unlawful games are ſuch as the Laws of the Land make unlawful, which binde the conſcience in things indifferent: Now among unlawful Games, the Laws reckon Dicing, and ſo doth the Law of God, becauſe it hath no <hi>good report in it, no praiſe, no vertue,</hi> Phil. 4.8. and then it cannot bee indifferent.</p>
                     <p>And the like may bee ſaid of all thoſe Playes, the ground of which is lot, ſeeing a lot is an Oracle and declaration of Gods will, a part of his Name, more ſolemn than any Oath, and muſt not bee vainly uſed, or for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>It is no lot, wee uſe it for no ſuch end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is no matter; the <hi>Jews</hi> caſt lots for our Saviours garments, the nature of lots remained, though the good end was neglected.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Gods providence over-rules all other games.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In other lawful Games that depend upon wit, ſtrength, or skill, our own infirmity, or want of skill, may bee blamed in all imperfection: But here becauſe the ground is a lot, wherein wee have no cunning (unleſs by cogging and cheating which very Royſters condemn) nothing can bee accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but Gods immediate direction: Let men conſider whom they diſhonour, when they ſay, What luck, what chance is this?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lyranus</hi> in his <hi>praeceptorium,</hi> by nine Reaſons proveth the unlawfulneſs of playing with Dice.</p>
                     <p>The Heathens themſelves condemned it even in their Princes; as <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the life of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> reports, that it was his greateſt blemiſh, that hee was at leaſure to play at Dice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chilo</hi> being ſent from the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to <hi>Corinth,</hi> upon an Ambaſſage, and finding the Senators of that City at Cards and Dice, would perform no part of his Meſſage, ſaying, Hee would not ſo much diſhonour the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> as that they ſhould either make or meddle with ſuch perſons. Were ſuch Games infamous among Heathens? How unworthy then are they among Chriſtians?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As ſports and playes muſt bee indifferent in their nature, ſo alſo in their uſe; and that is when wee confine our ſelves to the lawful manner of uſing them.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="471" facs="tcp:40284:238"/>1 The perſons muſt have two qualities; 1 They muſt bee pure,
<note place="margin">2 The manner.</note> 
                        <hi>For to the pure all things are pure</hi> and to none elſe. Secondly, They muſt bee weary, and need refreſhing; for God alloweth not the moſt lawful ſports, till the body and minde ſtand in need; till then, wee muſt bee buſie in better things.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 All ſports muſt bee ſanctified by the word and prayer, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Prayer before, and Thankſgiving after, becauſe wee are in more danger to forget our ſelves herein, than in any thing elſe; in that wee unbend our ſelves from our ordinary buſineſs, and think wee may take more liberty than uſual. A ſtrange leſſon to Gameſters.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 All ſports muſt bee joyned with the fear of God, <hi>Rejoyce with trembling,</hi> which ſuffers not a man to powre out himſelf to pleaſure.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 All muſt bee joyned with moderation agreeing to the time, perſon, and place. A man muſt not bee a <hi>lover of pleaſure,</hi> ſet upon ſport, as ſome, who are given over to ſport, never weary, all the week long is too little. The Apoſtle commands, <hi>to rejoyce, as not rejoycing;</hi> that is, to bee ſo moderate and retired, as not to over-value ſports, nor to ſet our affections on them, as thoſe who have other things to do. So obſerve due circumſtances: Some at Cards and Dice turn night into day, and ſit up all night and day, longer than they could for ten times more money bee bound to any good buſineſs. Some wickedly incroach on time allotted to Gods ſervice, ſome part of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and other times; Some keep from Church, and ſome run from Church with their Games in their mouthes: Others beſtow upon them too much time which ſhould bee imployed in the calling, either general or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and ſo much indamage themſelves thereby. The Mowers rifle is good to bee ſet to his Sythe when it is blunt; But if hee doth nothing but what ſtill, hee ſpoyls the Sythe, and hinders his work. Therefore let us mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate our ſelves in our ſports, according to the moſt ſober of our age, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, condition, and ſort of life, and uſe them with ſuch as are both godly and wiſe, who may rather watch over us that wee offend not, rather than draw and provoke us ſo to do.</p>

Now Decency requires ſeemly and cleanly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, nor ſordid, baſe, and ſlovenly; and condemneth that affected naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men and women, eſpecially who wear their cloaths, ſo as they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the nakedneſs of many parts of their body; whereas ſin hath caſt ſhame on every part, and calls for a cover over all but for neceſſity.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are; For the Apoſtle ſimply condemneth not the things themſelves, which are the good creatures of God, nor all uſe of them in Ornament, which <hi>Rebeccah</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> being advanced, and all the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi>
                        <pb n="475" facs="tcp:40284:240"/> women, ware in Ear-rings and Bracelets, which was not their ſin.
<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> But hee condemns in them,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The over-common and unſeaſonable uſe; for Ornaments are not fit for all perſons and times, but muſt bee uſed ſparingly, not commonly, having reſpect to times and ſolemnity. They bee for great, not for common men, neither for thoſe every day: The rich man in the Goſpel is condemned for going in fine purple <hi>every day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hee condemns the affected and exceſſive uſe of them; for they more affected the adorning of the body, than of the minde, to which the Apoſtle in both places calleth them: Whereas a Chriſtian muſt chiefly provide for the adorning of the minde inwardly.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Hee condemns their offenſive uſe of them, who did not uſe them as the ſober and grave Matrons of their years and age; but being newly converted from the Heathens, ſtill retained the Heatheniſh Ornaments, and would not, being Chriſtians, bee put down by the Heathens, but retained the former manner of adorning themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Hee condemns their end in wearing theſe things, which was to ſet forth their bodies, and pride up themſelves with their Ornaments; whereas all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments muſt bee uſed to Gods glory, while wee adorn his Temple, and not to draw mens eyes upon us.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>May not a man wear long hair for Ornament?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In Ornament wee muſt look wee bee without offence, and that is, when wee frame our ſelves to the example of the grave and ſober, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us count the faſhion of flaring Locks, Effeminate, and Ruffian-like.</p>
                     <p>Again, in Ornament, as in every thing elſe, wee muſt expreſs godlineſs, modeſty, and ſobriety; whereas this faſhion of men, is received as a badge of a ſight minde, and an intemperate perſon.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>The Nazarites did nouriſh their hair.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That was by the ſpecial Law of their Profeſſion, which Profeſſion and Law, and all is now ceaſed. If thou wilt bee a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> thou muſt drink no Wine, nor ſtrong Beer; a hard law to many of our Lockſters. That of <hi>Abſolom</hi> doth not neceſſarily conclude againſt it, that his hair became his halter; yet it is not to bee paſſed lightly: Compare his pride with his fall, and wee may obſerve that God doth ordinarily puniſh us in that wherein wee ſin.</p>

Have compaſſion on ſome, <hi>putting difference,</hi> others ſave with fear. Again, 3 Many precepts can never bee obſerved without it: As firſt, in things reſpecting God, <hi>Caſt not holy things to Dogs,</hi> Matth. 7.6. that is, ſuch as are known to bee wilful repellers of the truth, leſt they prophane them, and tear you. Secondly, In things of men, <hi>Do good to all, but eſpecially to the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of faith.</hi> Thirdly, concerning our ſelves, <hi>Hee that hateth, will counterfeit, though hee ſpeak favourably, beleeve him not, &amp;c.</hi> Prov. 26.24, 25. Therefore labour to diſcern one from another. 4 There is great difference between an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> and an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> between a <hi>Jew,</hi> and a <hi>Samaritan;</hi> And wee muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:40284:241"/> the difference, wherein the Lord goes before us, who though hee bee patient and good unto all, yet hee is ſpecially <hi>good unto Iſrael, even the upright of heart.</hi>

Againſt this Rule fail thoſe general men, whom all faſhions and companies pleaſe well enough, no matter whether Proteſtants or Papiſts, Religions, or prophane, Drunkards or ſober, ſwearers, or fearers of an oath; as the <hi>Jews,</hi> they put no difference between Chriſt and the Theeves who were crucified with him, but onely that Chriſt was the worſt. Others put difference between the godly and others, ſuch as between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> they will not meddle with a man truly fearing God, for a diſh of water.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1 Rule, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection Heb. 13.1.</note> THE firſt of theſe Rules is in reſpect of our affection, to love the godly with <hi>brotherly love.</hi> It is true indeed, all men muſt bee loved, but here is required a more ſpecial love, as between brethren, of which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Joyn with godlineſs brotherly kindneſs,</hi> becauſe they are of the ſame Father, and Family of God. The reaſon of this Rule is this: The nearer any man comes to God or expreſſeth him, the more right hee hath into our
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:40284:242"/> affections for Gods Image ſake; and here is a ſtraighter bond than that of Nature. The Apoſtle makes this a mark of Gods childe, to <hi>love the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.10. And <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.1.</note> 
                        <hi>That all his delight was in the Saints, the excellent on earth.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Bee affectioned one to another with brotherly love.</hi> And becauſe this cannot bee,
<note place="margin">Many things in Gods children might draw our eyes unto them.</note> except men ſee more in Gods people than ordinary, therefore labour to ſee, 1 Their high birth and true nobility; <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Not of blood, nor of the will of fleſh, but of God.</hi> 2 Their kindred and alliance; they are Sons of God, brethren of Chriſt, who was <hi>not aſhamed to call them brethren,</hi> Heb. 2.11. 3 Their high office and place, whom Chriſt the faithful witneſs, the firſt born from the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the earth, hath loved and waſhed from their ſins by his blood, to make them <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts unto God,</hi> Rev. 1.5. 4 Their beauty and glory, being covered with <hi>long white Robes of righteouſneſs and holineſs;</hi> ſuch as Kings anciently were diſtinguiſhed by, wherein they appear moſt lovely and graceful to God, Angels, and good men; nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their perfection of beauty, ſeeing they are compleat in Chriſt the head of all power, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. 5 Their preſent wealth, and future expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Their goods are God the chief good, Chriſt given them of God for righteouſneſs, the Holy Ghoſt ſent unto their hearts for ſanctification and conſolation; eternal election, effectual calling, juſtification. And their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expectation is the City ot God, the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which God hath prepared for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16.</p>
                     <p>Now were it a wiſe courſe for a man to diſaffect the chief favourite of his King? And are not Gods children Gods chief favourites? Were it a ſafe thing to hate the people of God, to diſaffect them, to lowre upon them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord obſerves what looks are caſt down upon his children, as in <hi>Cain?</hi> How was <hi>Balaam</hi> ſlain by the Lord for deſiring evil to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could do them none but by his wicked counſel? Theſe are the laſt times, in which men are lovers of themſelves, and of men onely for their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. they love them for their wealth, eaſe and pomp, not for God and his graces.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Wee muſt not onely affect their perſons,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chuſe fit matter to confer of in company, either by calling to minde things heard, or by ſtirring up to profitable hearing, diligent proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in-offenſive walking, watchful ſpeaking, and the like; or if need bee, of Admonition, Exhortation, or Reproof, ſhew thy love therein; full clouds will diſtill rain, light will ſhine abroad, and charitable knowledge is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Bee ſure to perform theſe private Chriſtian duties in good, and holy, and unrebukeable manner: As 1, Orderly, thoſe beginnings which are fitteſt in gifts and place, as <hi>Elihu ſpake in his turn.</hi> 2 Humbly, none ſeeking to ſpeak beyond his skill and reach. 3 Wiſely, watching the fitteſt time and beſt occaſion. 4 Meekly and lovingly, without reaſonings and murmuring, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. none croſſing others, but through love one forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another, adviſing in the <hi>ſpirit of meekneſs,</hi> and with offering to ſubmit
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:40284:243"/> themſelves in other caſes to receive words of Exhortation and Admonition. 5 Conſcionably, ſo as in all ſuch meetings and conference every one bee an helper to the truth, 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. to finde it out, not to obſcure, or weaken it. By theſe means wee ſhall have cauſe to rejoyce in our Chriſtian fellowſhip, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 23.14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Obſerve the graces that are in others, for a pattern to our ſelves, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1 7. for our own provocation and imitation: Yea, ſpy and incourage the graces of God in the weakeſt and meaneſt Chriſtian, ſo framing our ſelves to that mark of a good man, <hi>who honours all that fear the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 15.4. Neither let the ſtrongeſt ſcorn to receive help from the weakeſt; <hi>Moſes</hi> was content to bee adviſed by <hi>Jethro,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Abigail;</hi> and note <hi>Pauls</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.12. hee hoped to come, and bee comforted by their faith, as well as to help theirs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In the uſe of good company, beware of giving any occaſion of ſcandal, or offence to any, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.7, 8. leave no ill ſmell behinde thee; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the note of pride, conceit, forwardneſs in ſpeaking, frowardneſs, or ſtiffeneſs in thine own ſenſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Hee that loveth his brother, there is no occaſion of ſtumbling or ſcandal in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Motives thus to carry our ſelves in good company.</note> Motives to provoke us wiſely to carry our ſelves in good company.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Conſider how in our company wee are eſpecially to watch, ſeeing in no part of our life wee are ſooner corrupted than in that, ſeeing in no part of our life wee do ſo much diſcover our ſelves, and ſeeing in no part thereof, wee do either more good, or more harm, ſeeing wee do nothing without witneſs, and ſhould do nothing which wee would not have exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 As Satan layes ſnares every where, ſo alſo in our company one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not ſo much to bring the godly to ſuch exceſs of riot, as hee effecteth in wicked ſocieties, where is ſwearing, gaming, drinking, rayling, &amp;c. but to make them unfruitful, and keep them from the good they might do; and ſo far prevaileth, as ſometimes impertinent ſpeech, ſometime debate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting ſpeeches ariſe, and the moſt tolerable ſpeech is worldlineſs which ſtealeth away the heart, and the time; ſo as ſome who intended more good to themſelves and others, carry away hearts ſmiting them, for not better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying that opportunity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 There is apparent loſs, when wee watch not to do or receive good, in company with good men. For godly men by reaſon of their Callings, and diſtance of places, ſeldome meet; and when they do, they loſe the gain of that time in their ſpecial Calling; and it they get it not up in the furtherance of the general calling of a Chriſtian, it is utterly loſt. And what but this makes the mindfulneſs one of another ſweet in their abſence, when there was reaped ſo good fruit one of another in their preſence?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 By this wiſe and fruitful carriage of company and meetings of good men, Chriſtians ſhall ſtop the mouthes of ſuch as are ever complaining of, and accuſing Chriſtian meetings to bee ſcarce to any other purpoſe, but to detract, defame, ſlander, cenſure, to ſtrengthen one another in faction, and the like. Or if ſuch mouthes will not bee ſhut, yet the conſcience of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may rejoyce in the contrary innocency, and not bee dejected by ſuch falſe teſtimony.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Rule.</hi> In our ſpeeches, let us bee Proctors and Solicitors for the Saints, ſpeak wiſely and willingly of the good wee know in our brethren,
<note place="margin">3 Apology.</note> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the cauſe, perſon, and name of good men to our power. The ſincerity of love between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> was manifeſt, in that <hi>Jonathan</hi> defended <hi>Davids</hi> innocency to <hi>Saul</hi> his Father, not onely to the loſs of his Kingdome, but the danger of his own life. <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> the Blackmoor ſpake a good word for <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and was ſaved from deſtruction, when his Maſter <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah</hi>
                        <pb n="481" facs="tcp:40284:243"/> was ſlain. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> even in the beginning of grace ſpake for Chriſt, when the whole Council was againſt him. And how dangerous is it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and invent words againſt Gods children, as <hi>Davids</hi> enemies, to belye, or reproach them, to raiſe or receive ſlanders againſt them? If ſuch as ſtand not for grace ſhall fall, then much more they that ſtand againſt it. How needful is this Apology for them, againſt the reproaches and ſcorns of this age? How earneſtly would children ſpeak for their parents, brethren, or kindred? Even ſo ſhould it bee here. It is nothing to ſpeak for a man when others ſpeak for him.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 In regard of God; 1 <hi>Whoſe</hi> Commandement is, <hi>That all our wayes bee ordered aright,</hi> Prov. 4.26. and that the Saints <hi>walk worthy of the Lord, and pleaſe him in all things,</hi> Col. 1.10. 2 <hi>Whoſe</hi> Word muſt bee our Rule, to which wee muſt continually frame our whole courſe, and every part thereof: For firſt, The moral Law is a perpetual Rule, binding at all times without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. 2 The Precepts of it are to make the <hi>Word our continual Counſellor, to binde it to us, not to let it depart, but to meditate in it night and day.</hi> And what is it leſs than Blaſphemy to charge the Saints with folly, ſingularity, and a Saintiſh purity, in that wherein they were moſt acceptable to God? As <hi>David ſet the Lord before him continually;</hi> and when hee profeſſeth his great love to the Law, ſaith, <hi>That all the day long his meditation is in it,</hi> Pſal. 119.79. Read wee not, that the <hi>twelve Tribes ſerved God inſtantly, night and day?</hi> Act. 26.7. and the Apoſtles were aſſured, <hi>they had a good conſcience in all things,</hi> Heb. 13.18. Was this care (ſo inceſſant) commendable in them, and is the ſame godly care now grown a vice, an hateful practice or hereſie? 3 <hi>Who</hi> being a God of pure eyes, will ſtrictly ſtand for juſtice. And do wee fear wee can bee too ſtrict, who are to give account of every idle word, and roaving thought, much more of every unwarrantable action? Are wee not to paſs a ſtrict and ſtraight judgement, wherein every ſecret ſhall be made open, and in which it ſhall bee rewarded according to our works? And ſhall the Devil delude us, or the wicked world make us beleeve wee need not bee ſo ſtraight-laced, as to ſay with <hi>David, I will look to my wayes?</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 In reſpect of our ſelves; no watch or circumſpection can bee ſufficient to us, whoſe natures are carried to evill as naturally as to our ordinary food.

                     <p>ANd whereas our age aboundeth with men of prophane mindes and mouthes, who would turn all this our glory into ſhame, and cenſure this ſpeech of the Holy Ghoſt, which preſcribeth a ſtrict, preciſe, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate walking: (why, ſay they, what need men bee ſo ſtrict? and, ſhall no man come to heaven, but ſuch as are ſo ſtrict and curious?) and the whole world, almoſt, thinks it a moſt idle and needleſs courſe; wee will therefore anſwer ſome Objections that are made againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Object. 1. <hi>A great many have lived honeſtly and well, that were never ſo fooliſh and ſtrict, I hope to ſerve God, and do no man harm, and what need more?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>Wee muſt walk by Rule,</hi> not by example, except it bee of the beſt, not of the moſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The <hi>Phariſees</hi> led a civil life, were outwardly very juſt, to the tything of Mint and Anniſe, and very devout in their worſhip, and yet if our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs exceed not theirs, wee can never enter into the Kingdome of heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The righteouſneſs of God goes beyond all civil and outward righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; it is inward, <hi>in Spirit and truth;</hi> It cuts off not onely outward acts of Murder, Uncleanneſs, Theft, &amp;c. but inward motions of Hatred, Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Covetouſneſs; It ſtrikes at roots and branches, and hates the leaſt and ſecreteſt evil, which civil righteouſneſs makes no bones of.</p>
                     <p>Object. 2. <hi>But this circumſpect and ſtrict walking is taken up but by a few, and thoſe of the meaneſt; ſome men of great wiſdome, place, and learning favour it not, but ſcorn and oppoſe it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſtianity was ever hated by the moſt of the world, becauſe of the Croſs; the Church is <hi>black, becauſe the Sun looks on her,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cant. 1.5.</note> 
                        <hi>but comely</hi> to God and his Angels; and this makes few enter that way. 2 The Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly meets with this Objection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Not many mighty, not many noble, not many wiſe; but God hath choſen a few poor people,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Zeph. 3.11.</note> 
                        <hi>and they ſhall call upon his Name.</hi> And why not many of thoſe? Becauſe they cannot ſo eaſily deny themſelves and this evil world, which they muſt do that will bee ſaved. 3 Let us not wholly caſt our eyes upon the examples of the world now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, and, at laſt, ſo at worſt; but upon ſuch as formerly have been ſet as eye-marks in the Scripture, and wee ſhall finde ſome, both great, and noble, and learned, going before us in ſtrict and circumſpect walking. The holy Patriarchs, <hi>Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob;</hi> godly and zealous Kings, <hi>David, Solomon, Joſiah;</hi> the holy Apoſtles, who <hi>endeavoured alwayes to have a clear conſcience before God and all men,</hi> Act. 24.16. Yea, the moſt wiſe, noble, and learned that ever was, the Son of God, whoſe converſation was ſuch as none could accuſe him of ſin. Theſe are <hi>the cloud of witneſſes,</hi> which wee muſt follow in running the race ſet before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.</p>
                     <p>Object. 3. <hi>But what an impoſsible Commandement is this, and who can bear it? Can wee bee Saints in this world, thus to order our ſelves in every thing? Wee are ſinners, and muſt bee ſinners and cannot bee thus ſtrict as you require. Wee hope we generally mean well, and God (wee hope) will ſupply the reſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ſcope of this plea is, to give over all, becauſe they cannot attain all; which is but a falſe fire, by which the Devil diſcourageth many from <hi>the narrow way,</hi> and the narrow looking to their own way. For true it is, that wee call with the Scripture for a keeping of all Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, alwayes, and to live with God, and walk with him; but with Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:40284:247"/> interpretation, which accepteth the will, deſire, and endeavour to walk with God in every thing; which cannot but in ſome meaſure bee found in a true beleever, and cannot but in Chriſt bee accepted, where it is true and hearty. Thus the Scriptures interpret themſelves, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.7. <hi>If Solomon ſhall endeavour to keep my Commandments. &amp;c.</hi> Hoſ. 6.3. <hi>We ſhall endeavour to know the Lord.</hi> What can God accept leſs, or a good heart tender leſs, than hearty wiſhes, where ſtrength is wanting to pleaſe God in all things? 2 Let us by the ſtrictneſs of the Commandement conſider whence wee are fallen, and ſee our impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and confeſs our failings, but not therefore allow our ſelves in any evil, or venture on any ſin which we might by this <hi>Circumsſpection</hi> avoid, or remit our endeavour in reſpect of all Gods Commandements. 3 For ſuch as think it ſufficient to mean well in general; Conſider this, that as no Maſter is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if his ſteward bring him in a general Bill of great ſummes ſpent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee may hide much deceit, but ſets down no dayes accounts, or weeks bills of parcels; no more in the matter of heavenly treaſure, is it enough to hide himſelf in general good meanings, but in every particular to avoid deceit and ſuſpicion of it. And as it is with a Traveller in an unknown way, who will not go at random, nor count it a ſufficient direction to bee ſet Eaſtward or Weſtward, but hee will ask every man of every Town, and take good heed of every mark, to paſs him from one place to another; ſo in this our paſſage to heaven, wee muſt keep our ſpecial directions, and walk with God in every thing, if wee will happily paſs unto heaven.</p>
                     <p>Object. 4. <hi>But what need ſuch daily and continual troubling of our ſelves? What was the Sabbath made for, but for Gods ſervice? and wee keep our Church as well as any; but for the week-dayes wee have Callings to follow, and cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch things; and it were better if ſome of theſe nice fellows were more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in their Calling, as wee be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>in the midſt of a mans houſe,</hi> and not at Church, where the Phariſeee is often above the Publican. 3 Thou haſt a Calling on the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, in which thou muſt ſweat and abide who ever thou art; but thou muſt not ſo play the good husband, as to become a worldling. <hi>

                     <p>Object. 5. <hi>But this is fitter for Miniſters and cloyſtered perſons, who have given themſelves to continual devotion, than for ordinary and common men, who are not acquainted with ſuch novelties.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If all Chriſtians bee alike ſubject to ſin, all have need to bee continually alike fenced againſt it. If all have the ſame enemies, all had need ſtand upon their ground. If one mans heart bee as wicked as anothers, every man had need ſet a watch round about himſelf. And if any have more need than other, it is unlearned and ſimple perſons, who want ſuch means of helping themſelves, as learned Preachers have. 2 As for the novelty of this <hi>Circumſpect courſe,</hi> wee muſt needs ſay it is ſo to ſuch as are of <hi>Feſtus</hi> his ſuit, who thinks <hi>Paul</hi> learned even to madneſs, to call him to ſuch ſtrictneſs; or

                        <hi>Gallio</hi> his Diſciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. who being of no Religion, cannot bee at leaſure to give it hearing. But wee have ſeen it to be no novelty to the Spirit of God, every where charging it upon us, nor to the godly guided by his Spirit, who can neither <hi>bee idle, nor unfruitful in the work of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. 6. <hi>I like ſuch as can bee ſo ſtrict, and I could wiſh ſo to bee; but then I muſt part from the pleaſure and joy of my life: For this continual watch and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection is full of melancholy and uncomfortable; it hinders neighbours from ſports and merriments, breaks off good company, and makes the husband and wife often look heavily one upon another; and beſides, I ſhould loſe ſome profits and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and wrong my eſtate by neglecting it.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a clean contrary judgement to Gods Spirit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Her wayes are the wayes of pleaſures.</hi> Gods wiſdome ordering the wayes of man, brings true joy and pleaſure. For, is there no joy in God, in his word,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. Joh. 16.</note> which was wont to bee <hi>as ſweet as the hony-comb,</hi> nor in the Spirit of God, which is called the Comforter? Is it ſuch a thing of heavineſs to live with God? Alas! What is ſuch an heart made of? 2 What delights do wee call men from, but ſuch as are carnal, fooliſh, periſhing, and unlawful; is ſtollen waters ſo ſweet and ſavoury to corrupt fleſh, the forbidden fruit which a Chriſtian ſhould neither touch, nor taſte, and happy hee were if hee never ſaw it? 3 There is no ſorrow in godly life; but all the ſorrow of <hi>Gods</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, is, that they cannot bee more godly. Lay this for a ground that <hi>God</hi> is thy chief delight, and no man may bee ſo moderately joyful as thou. 4 For pleaſant companionſhip, thou loſeſt no good company, but exchangeſt for better; thou haſt now fellowſhip with <hi>God,</hi> union with Jeſus Chriſt, the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable preſence of <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſed Spirit, the attendance of the Angels, the communion of the Saints, the benefit of their prayers, comfort, and example.

                     <p n="2">2 A circumſpect man looks round about him, and ſo ordereth his many buſineſſes, as one hinder not the other, but all may go forward, and ſo ſaveth one commodity, as another bee not loſt, or lye in hazard: So a circumſpect Chriſtian caſteth his occaſions; as, ſeeing every Chriſtian duty is enjoyned him, hee hath reſpect to <hi>all</hi> Gods Commandements. Duties of piety ſhall not juſtle out civil duties, nor civil duties eat out duties of piety; but as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ne hand helps another, ſo one table ſhall further the other, one calling forward another; yea, hee looks to the thriving of all his graces. Hee will walk very humbly before God, but ſo as hee maintain his joy in God. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſhall not damp his zeal, his zeal ſhall not out-run his knowledge. His providence ſhall not leſſen his faith, nor his faith deſtroy his providence. His love with mens perſons brings him not into love with their ſins, and his hatred of their ſins, impeacheth not his love of their perſons. His righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to men hindreth not his mercy, neither doth cruel mercy withſtand or thruſt down needful juſtice. Thus hee is buſie in maintaining all his graces, all of them beeing of great uſe, and all of them flowing from the ſame Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 A circumſpect man will bee ſure not to diſadvantage himſelf by his words, but will ſpeak to his own profit: So a circumſpect Chriſtians words make for his own beſt advantage: Hee will ſpeak for Gods glory, for good men,
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.6.</note> and good cauſes. Hee will bee ſure to profit himſelf, and others with <hi>gracious</hi> and Religious ſpeeches, and bee ſilent where fruitful ſpeech will not bee heard. Exerciſe to good ſpeeches, brings a dexterity and readineſs of well-ſpeaking, to which every Chriſtian is exhorted, Col. 4.6. <hi>Let your ſpeeches bee gracious alwayes, and powdered with ſalt, that yee may know how to anſwer every man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 As a wary and circumſpect man proves a good husband for the world, ſo circumſpect Chriſtians are the beſt husbands for their ſouls: Such a one hath wiſdome and will, to increaſe his eſtate of grace by every thing, and thinks himſelf then truly rich, when hee thrives in the beſt Commodities. Hee conceives himſelf rich, not when hee hath things about him to leave to his heirs, but when hee hath his Wealth perſonally in himſelf, and for himſelf, ſuch Wealth as hee carries to Heaven with him. A circumſpect Chriſtian will not win the whole world with the loſſe of his own ſoul, which is nothing but to make his heirs happy in his own eternal miſery. A circumſpect Chriſtian is not ſo careful to heap up gold, as good works in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and by works of Mercy and Love, hee makes himſelf Bags that waxe not old, a Treaſure in Heaven that can never faile, where the Theef commeth not, not the moth corrupteth, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.33. A circumſpect Chriſtian is not ſo careful for the ſoyling, tilling, and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ground, the mounding of his Paſture, the weeding of his Field, the pruning of his Trees, the feeding of his Cattel; as in fencing the heart againſt Temptation, in ſowing the Seed of Gods Word, in weeding of Sin by the roots out of his Soul, in feeding and foſtering of Grace. Here is a good Husband for himſelf: Hee hath that within himſelf that is better than all without him, and requires more tendance than they all.</p>
                     <p>How improvident then are wee in our general Calling, whiles wee take not opportunities of good in publick or private, but ſlip many Leſſons, Sermons and comforts on the Sabbath, and on Week dayes? And whiles wee will not offer a ſacrifice of Alms, when God ſets up an Altar before us? How do our ſpecial Callings eat out out care of the general, and are
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:40284:248"/> all in civilities, whiles for the thriſt of Grace, wee are altogether idle and unprofitable? How many vain and vile ſpeeches, unfruitful, unſavoury, and hurtful, do our corrupt hearts ſend out, according to their own ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by ſwearing, ſlandering, lying, curſing, and the like? How bad husbands are men for their ſouls, whiles they have not a Horſe, a Pig, Sheep, yea, ſcarce a Dog about their houſe, but is more tended, and better provided for than their ſouls? whiles they will ſcarce let any Dunghil lye about their houſe, ſo naſty as their ſouls? nor any patch of ground ſo neglected as their own hearts, that they grow like Neules and Brambles, to bee cut up, and caſt into the fire?</p>
